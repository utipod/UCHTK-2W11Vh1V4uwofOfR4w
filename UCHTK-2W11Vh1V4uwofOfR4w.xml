    <description>(28 Jan 2022) Divers, veterinarians and the coast guard were mounting a rescue operation Friday to help a whale calf that had become trapped in shallow water in a seaside area of the Greek capital.&#13;
The animal was an injured young Cuvier’s beaked whale, or Ziphius cavirostris, according to Arion, a research organization that provides veterinary care for stranded cetaceans. &#13;
The species usually inhabits deep waters, and it was unclear how it had been injured and why it became stranded in the Alimos area of southern Athens. &#13;
On Thursday, the whale had been sighted in shallow water in the nearby area of Vouliagmeni, and divers had been called in to lead it out to sea. &#13;
The operation had initially appeared successful, but the animal returned to shallow waters Friday morning.&#13;
“The prognosis unfortunately isn’t good,” said Environment and Energy Deputy Minister Giorgos Amyras, who was at the scene. &#13;
“The fact that it has been in these shallow waters for so many hours doesn’t give us much hope. But we of course are doing everything possible to save the animal,” he added. &#13;
He said two specialized veterinarians, a specialized veterinary nurse and four aid organizations had been brought in to try to save the whale.&#13;
A blood sample had been drawn and sent for analysis to determine what medication the animal might need, while an antibiotic had already been administered, Amyras said.&#13;

The city of New York has given an emotional final salute to a rookie police officer gunned down with his partner a week ago. 
A funeral Mass for Jason Rivera was held Friday morning at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
Mayor Eric Adams, who is a retired police captain, says he sees an echo of himself in the slain officer who had joined a department he had seen as flawed in hopes of improving it. 
The 22-year-old Rivera was recently married and barely into his second year on the force. 
He and Officer Wilbert Mora were fatally wounded when a gunman ambushed them in an apartment as they responded to a family dispute.
During the funeral service, New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell posthumously promoted Rivera to the rank of Detective First Grade.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) The resort island of Bali is reopening to foreign travelers from all countries, with direct international flights resuming for the first time in two years.
But mandatory quarantine remains in place for all visitors.
In October, Bali had said it would begin welcoming foreign arrivals from 19 countries that meet World Health Organization criteria, such as having COVID-19 cases under control.
But there were no direct international flights to Bali until Thursday, when Garuda Indonesia, the state-owned airline, operated its first international flight in two years from Tokyo to Bali.
Singapore Airlines will introduce a regular direct route to and from Denpasar in Bali starting Feb. 16, said an official at Bali's international airport.
Fully vaccinated travelers still need to quarantine for five days.
Travelers with just one dose of COVID-19 vaccine must quarantine for seven days.
In 2019, Bali's airport accommodated more than 200 international flights with at least one million passengers per day.
The island was closed to international flights after COVID-19 hit Indonesia - the world's fourth most populous country - in 2020.
Tourism is the main source of income in Bali, which is home to more than 4 million people.
Indonesia has reported more than 4.4 million total COVID-19 cases, including 27,197 new infections and 38 deaths on Thursday in the latest 24-hour period.
Health Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin has said Indonesia's latest wave, which is driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, will likely peak at the end of February or in early March.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Thousands of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been displaced after they fled ongoing clashes between the Congolese army and M23 fighters this week. 
On Tuesday, a fresh attack carried out by the March 23 Movement, or M23 , targeted a Congolese army position in the territory of Rutshuru, just north of the city of Goma in eastern Congo. 
While authorities confirmed the attack, they did not provide any details about it. 
Eyewitnesses told The Associated Press that they saw gun fights and dead bodies. 
Since the beginning of this week, inhabitants from six villages in the country's east – including, Bukima, Nyesisi, and Ruhanga – have fled the violence. 
At least 2,000 people are now living in improvised shelters, in churches, schools or with host families. 
On Friday, the AP interviewed several eyewitnesses who fled to Kibumba and found shelter in a local church. 
Baseme Mashukano was a resident of Nyesisi, one of the six villages caught in the cross fire.
The attack began in Nyesisi, Ngungo, Kanombe. When we were in the field on Wednesday, we heard bullets over the hills and we fled. We abandoned everything and now we are here in Kibumba. We spend the night in the church while others sleep outside, we have nothing to eat, no food, no water or medicine, said Baseme. 
Another person displaced by the conflict, Sarah Kasigwa, says in the chaos she lost her three children and husband. 
We saw several dead people she said. We are sleeping here, in this school, on the ground. There is just cement, no blanket, we suffer a lot. 
32-year-old Tumaini Anouarite, a mother of five, said that she saw soldiers firing bullets in the nearby hills, and gunfights between the army and M23 fighters. 
On Friday, MONUSCO blue helmets were deployed in the area. 
The M23, which also calls itself the Revolutionary Army of Congo, is a former rebellion of Congolese backed by Rwanda and Uganda, which was defeated in 2013. 
Since November, the movement has been accused of being behind several attacks against the army. 
The attack took place in the vicinity of Virunga National Park, a UNESCO heritage site, renowned for its large gorilla population.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Germany has a coronavirus wave powered by the omicron variant under control despite a string of new infection records, the health minister said Friday.
Cases as a result of the highly contagious variant in the European Union's most populous nation shot up at a later stage than in several other countries in the region. 
Officials attribute that to restrictions such as curbs on private gatherings, nightclub closures and requirements for restaurant and bar patrons to have received a booster shot or to present a negative test. 
Yet infections continue to rise steeply in the country of 83 million. 
On Thursday, new cases reported in the previous 24 hours topped 200,000 for the first time. 
On Friday, the infection rate reached another record of 1,073 new cases per 100,000 residents in a week.
Those numbers didn't deter Health Minister Karl Lauterbach from declaring that authorities “have the omicron wave in Germany well under control at the moment.”
Lauterbach told reporters in Berlin that the infection rate among the elderly - many of whom remain unvaccinated - is much lower than the average.
The omicron variant surge is so far slightly below projections, Lauterbach said. 
Daily infections are expected to reach up to 400,000 before falling, likely in mid-February. 
The drop could come later the same month because of a mutation of omicron known as BA.2, he added.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Hong Kong's leader on Friday vowed to maintain its “zero” COVID-19 policy as it plans to ramp up virus testing, amid record daily infections.
Carrie Lam said during a news conference that the city would raise its testing quota to 200,000 daily, and eventually aim for 300,000.
She added that its so-called “COVID-zero” strategy is still “the best policy” for Hong Kong, which has aligned itself with China’s policy to stamp out local transmission in the country, even as most of the world has moved toward living with the virus.
Hong Kong has reported some 1,300 cases since a new wave of infections began in late December of 2021, driven largely by the omicron variant. Local authorities require all positive coronavirus cases to go to hospital.
Lam also said Friday that the city was currently procuring “millions” of rapid antigen testing (RAT) kits, and that each resident will receive a kit.
Her announcement on Friday came shortly after health officials reported another 130 new local coronavirus infections, with almost half of them untraceable. 
To reach “COVID-zero”, Hong Kong has implemented one of the world's strictest quarantine measures and border controls, and often locks down buildings across the city for mass testing if cases have been detected.
Lam said the “zero” transmission target would be maintained “until we’ve reached a more satisfactory vaccination rate.”
Lam added that the Penny’s Bay quarantine camp will be converted into a community isolation facility to admit asymptomatic patients, and that home isolation could be implemented for secondary contacts of those already deemed close contacts of an infected person.
Currently, only about 64% of Hong Kong’s population has received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine, behind countries like Singapore where nearly 90% of the total population has been fully vaccinated. 
The city has currently reported a total of 14,013 infections since the beginning of the pandemic, with 213 deaths.

The Iraqi army says it was reinforcing the country's border with Syria, building more fences and deploying additional troops to prevent the Islamic State militants from infiltrating the border.
The new measures come after IS militants launched a large operation last week at a prison in Syria's Hassakeh where the extremist group sought to break thousands of its fighters out of the detention facility.

The Iraqi army on Thursday said it was reinforcing the country's border with Syria after U.S.-backed Kurdish forces clashed in a weeklong battle with Islamic State militants at a prison in the nearby Syrian city of Hassakeh.
Iraqi Army commanders said they were building a third fence and deploying additional troops at the borderline to prevent IS militants from infiltrating the border area.
The new fence starts from Sinjar district in Nineveh province all the way down to Al Qaim in Anbar province.  
Maj. Gen. Jabbar Naima Karam, the commander of West Nineveh Operations, said all observation towers are equipped with supporting weapons, night visions, and infrared cameras that are connected to operation rooms at the Border Force Command base in Mosul.  
  
We reassure our people that our units are capable of protecting the border, he said.
Hassakeh, where IS launched a large operation to break thousands of its fighters out of the Gweiran prison in northeastern Syria, is about 50 km (30 miles) away from the Iraqi border.
The attack was the biggest by IS since the fall of the group's caliphate in 2019 and came as the militants staged a number of deadly attacks in Syria and Iraq that stoked fears they may be staging a comeback.  
  
Chief of Staff of the Iraqi Army Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah assured the Iraqi people that the assault in the nearby Syrian city won't affect the border.
Our message to all of our people is that things are good on the Iraqi-Syrian borders. What is happening in Hassakeh did not have a big impact on our territories so far. 
The Islamic State group's territorial control in Iraq and Syria was crushed by a years-long U.S.-backed campaign, but some fighters remained at large in sleeper cells that have killed scores of Iraqis and Syrians over the past months.  
Iraq shares a 599-kilometer (372-mile) border with Syria.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Hundreds of hard-line worshippers in Tehran demonstrated after Friday prayers in support of the Iranian-backed Houthis and to condemn the killing of Yemenis by the Saudi-led coalition.
Protesters carried Yemeni flags and chanted slogans against Saudi Arabia and the United States as its ally. 
They called Saudis Wahhabi hypocrites who they said killed Shiites and children in Yemen. 
Demonstrators marched on the streets near Tehran's great Musalla Prayer Ground, while some members of the Houthi rebels distributed pictures of Yemeni victims. 
The protest came after the escalation of an offensive by the Saudi-led coalition on Houthi rebels, who are referred to as Ansarallah Movement by Tehran. 
A Saudi-led coalition airstrike hit a prison run by Yemen's Houthi rebels last Friday, killing at least 70 detainees and wounding dozens, a rebel minister said.  
The strike was part of a pounding aerial offensive that knocked the Arab world's poorest country off the internet. 
The intense campaign came after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed a drone and missile attack that struck inside the United Arab Emirates' capital earlier in the week - a major escalation in the conflict in Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition, with the UAE as a member, has battled the rebels since 2015. 
Taha al-Motawakel, Health Minister in the Houthi government which controls northern Yemen, said 70 detainees were killed at the prison and that he expected the number to rise as many others were seriously wounded.

Britain's Prince Andrew has given up his honorary membership of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews, one of the world's most prestigious golf clubs, as he fights allegations of sexual abuse that have forced him to retreat from public life.
The club in St. Andrews, Scotland, announced the move Friday (28 JANUARY 2022), two weeks after Andrew was stripped of his honorary military titles and roles with charitable organizations amid a U.S. civil lawsuit filed by a woman who says she was forced to have sex with Andrew when she was 17.
``I can confirm that the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews has received notification that the Duke of York will relinquish his honorary membership,'' the club said in a statement. ``We respect and appreciate his decision.''
Andrew, also known as the Duke of York, denies the allegations and has asked for a jury trial in the case filed in federal court in New York.
The decision to remove Andrew's military titles and charity positions was taken with the ``approval and agreement'' of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, Buckingham Palace said in a statement Jan. 13. The prince stopped performing royal duties two years ago, after a disastrous BBC interview that stoked criticism about his relationship with the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.
The Duke of York will continue not to undertake any public duties and is defending this case as a private citizen,'' the palace said earlier this month.
The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews was founded in 1754 and helped administer the rules of golf for 250 years until that role was handed over to another organization. It remains a private golf club with about 2,400 members worldwide.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Divers, veterinarians and the coast guard were mounting a rescue operation Friday to help a whale calf that had become trapped in shallow water in a seaside area of the Greek capital.
The animal was an injured young Cuvier’s beaked whale, or Ziphius cavirostris, according to Arion, a research organization that provides veterinary care for stranded cetaceans. 
The species usually inhabits deep waters, and it was unclear how it had been injured and why it became stranded in the Alimos area of southern Athens. 
On Thursday, the whale had been sighted in shallow water in the nearby area of Vouliagmeni, and divers had been called in to lead it out to sea. 
The operation had initially appeared successful, but the animal returned to shallow waters Friday morning.
“The prognosis unfortunately isn’t good,” said Environment and Energy Deputy Minister Giorgos Amyras, who was at the scene. 
“The fact that it has been in these shallow waters for so many hours doesn’t give us much hope. But we of course are doing everything possible to save the animal,” he added. 
He said two specialized veterinarians, a specialized veterinary nurse and four aid organizations had been brought in to try to save the whale.
A blood sample had been drawn and sent for analysis to determine what medication the animal might need, while an antibiotic had already been administered, Amyras said.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN: 
A new fashion house in Gaza teaches aspiring Palestinian designers in the hope they will develop their own businesses.

STORY-LINE:
A dozen Palestinian young men and women listen carefully as an instructor showed sketches of different dresses, shirts, and pants.
The students are members of a group attending a course at a new fashion house in the Gaza Strip.
Aya Eid and her husband Khalil Khudair opened the institution four months ago and are touting it as the first fashion design school in the impoverished Palestinian enclave.
The main motive behind Aya & Khalil Fashion House was a way for the couple to make a living. But they also hope to help others in Gaza, where unemployment is around 50% and is greater among youth. 
The goal is to help improve the economic situation in Gaza and providing as many work opportunities as possible for our students in factories after they graduate, said Khdair.
Gaza has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since the militant Hamas group seized power by force in 2007. 
Hamas and Israel fought four devastating wars since then, most recently in May. 
The fashion house opened in an apartment building in a downtown neighborhood which Israeli aircraft intensively targeted during the 11-day war.
Dozens have completed the fashion courses. 
Some have opened small enterprises at their houses and others are dreaming of having their own clothing label.
There are some college programs for fashion design in Gaza, but the tuition fees are out of reach for many young Gazans. 
Aya and Khalil's classes are a more attainable option for students like Safeia Al-Mashharawi, who is looking to supplement her family's income .

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) First, there was a pop, like firecrackers, then the world itself seemed to splinter.
Ramjan Rath felt a sharp pain. He looked down, and realized he was on fire. 
Rath, whose fuel tanker blew up in a deadly attack on Abu Dhabi last month claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, was standing by his truck filling out forms when the drones hit.
I saw my vehicle burning right in front of my eyes. … There was fire on my feet, he told The Associated Press on Wednesday from an Indian canteen in Mussafah, the industrial district of Abu Dhabi where the explosion occurred at a nearby state-owned oil facility, ADNOC. 
It wasn't clear what had happened, it all happened so fast. 
He remembers blood gushing from his leg as he ran for his life. Sirens howled. Hours later, he was in a hospital room.
Rath, 24, grew up in a tiny village in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, the youngest son of a farmer.
He knew nothing of the war that has riven Yemen, killed thousands of civilians and spawned the world's worst humanitarian disaster.
He'd never heard of the Iran-backed Houthis who seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014, and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition that includes the UAE.
Like the millions of other low-paid expats who make up the vast foreign labor force powering the UAE's economy, he had come to the country four years ago for work — the chance to carve out a bit of security for his parents and four older sisters in rural India.
It was a relentless life as a truck driver, working up to 12 hours a day to send money home. But it was a safe one.
Unlike in India, he said, the police were honest, the roads well-paved. He never feared for his life in the UAE - home to oil-rich Abu Dhabi and glitzy Dubai — long a refuge in a region mired in conflict and economic collapse. 
Yet that changed in a single, violent instant.
There's pain, physical and mental. When I sleep at night, or whenever I'm alone, I remember the blast, Rath said.
He recalls being consumed by guilt in the hospital bed, thinking the inferno must have been his fault, the result of some safety mishap he'd overlooked.
His leg wound required 10 stitches. The ache lingers, causing him to limp. His truck is gone. He can't work until he heals. He will never tell his family what happened to him, he said. It's a burden they cannot bear.
But he is alive, and for that he said, he is grateful. Three of his colleagues from India and Pakistan were killed — years of work and accumulated opportunities put to an abrupt end.
One of those colleagues was Hardeep Singh. Newly married at 29, he had a bachelor's degree in computing, enviable skills in the ancient Indian sport of Kabbaddi, and dreams of joining his young wife in Canada.
Till now we are not accepting (that) this thing happened, said Hardeep's cousin Gagandeep Singh.
If you see Hardeep's face, there's always a smile on his face, always, Singh said, speaking from their village in the northern Indian state of Punjab. 
Hardeep, known to his family as Appu, was the only child of a widow, saddled with the unyielding obligations of a breadwinner. After his wedding last spring, he returned to work in the UAE as a tanker driver for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.
The Saudi-led coalition has bombarded Yemen for years, drawing international criticism for hitting non-military targets like markets, schools, hospitals and wedding parties. 
The attack on Abu Dhabi that wounded Rath and killed Hardeep triggered a fierce wave of Saudi and Emirati airstrikes on Yemen that killed civilians and took the entire country off the internet for days.

      <description><![CDATA[(3 Feb 2022) Sarah Palin's libel suit against The New York Times went to trial Thursday in a case over the former Alaska governor's claims the newspaper damaged her reputation with an editorial linking her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting.
The trial is a rare example of a jury deciding the validity of a persistent refrain from Palin and other Republicans: That a biased news media is willing to bend the truth to make conservatives look bad.
Palin, a onetime Republican vice presidential nominee, told journalists as she arrived at the courthouse that she was looking for Justice for people who expect truth in the media.
A lawyer for The Times, David Axelrod, told jurors the editorial was primarily about gun laws, not Palin, and was not a political hit job.
Opening statements to the jury were initially scheduled for last week, but were postponed when Palin tested positive for COVID-19.
Palin will be the trial's star witness. She's seeking unspecified damages.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Ukraine's Defense Minister told reporters on Friday that Kyiv does not believe Russia is capable of mounting an invasion of Ukraine from the territory of Belarus, where large-scale military drills are underway.
Oleksii Reznikov delivered the statement in the Chernobyl Exclusion Zone where Ukrainian forces and Interior Ministry personnel held combat and rescue exercises.  
According to the minister, no signs of Russian troops forming a strike group to cross the Ukrainian border have been detected and the number of soldiers taking part in joint drills with Belarus alone do not constitute a sizeable enough force.
As tensions simmer between Moscow and the West over Ukraine, Russia and Belarus have launched large scale military drills mobilizing thousands of personnel and military equipment.
At the same time, the Ukrainian defense and interior ministries held drills to improve interdepartmental coordination during combat in difficult and semi-urban terrain.
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine's northern and eastern borders, raising concern that Moscow might invade again, as it did in 2014. The troop presence and uncertainty have unnerved Ukrainians and hurt the country's economy.
The Kremlin has denied that an invasion is planned and has demanded guarantees from the West that the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders will be halted, that Ukraine will never join the bloc and that the alliance's forces will be rolled back from Eastern Europe.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) A law requiring most adults in Austria to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is ready to take effect, but the sense of urgency that accompanied its announcement in November has largely evaporated. 
Few other countries look likely to go as far, as attention instead turns to loosening restrictions.
The Austrian mandate for residents aged 18 and over to get vaccinated — the first of its kind in Europe — cleared its last legislative hurdle Thursday when parliament's upper house approved what Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein called a forward-looking and active step. 
The President signed the legislation Friday.
It's expected to become law in the coming days but it will be a while before Austrians notice any practical change. 
It isn't clear when or even whether the toughest part of the plan, which was watered down from the initial proposal, will take effect. 
Only in mid-March will police start checking people's vaccination status during traffic stops and checks on coronavirus restrictions. 
People who can't produce proof of vaccination will be asked in writing to do so, and will be fined up to 600 euros ($680) if they don't; fines could reach 3,600 ($4,120) euros if people contest their punishment and full proceedings are opened.
In a third phase, officials would check the national vaccination register and send reminders to people who still aren't vaccinated on dates set by the government, leading to potential fines.
When and if those methodical checks start depends whether authorities, helped by a commission of experts that will report at least every three months, deem vaccination progress sufficient. 
The Austrian mandate — which will exempt pregnant women, people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons and those who have recently recovered from COVID-19 — was first conceived as cases caused by the delta variant surged amid concern that the country's vaccination rate was low for Western Europe. At present, 69% of the population is considered fully vaccinated.
Officials argue that, even with the now-dominant omicron variant causing milder illness and Austria preparing to ease some coronavirus restrictions, the mandate makes sense.
The Chief Doctor for the Samaritan Federation of Vienna told The Associated Press that while she believes the mandate may help give vaccination figures a boost, especially among those who are concerned about the mRNA vaccines, those holding back due to steadfast beliefs wont be persuaded. 
An absolute anti-vaxxer won't be persuaded by the vaccine mandate. Those people will pay the fines, Susanne Drapalik said.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) A batch of cocaine that has killed at least 23 people in Argentina appears to have been laced with a synthetic opioid, and police are scrambling to get as much of it off the streets as they can.
Health authorities say at least 84 people have been hospitalized after using the contaminated cocaine, some of whom remain on life-saving respiratory support. 
The victims were mostly young Argentines from poor neighborhoods around the nation's capital, Buenos Aires.
Police had confiscated 15,000 small bags of the contaminated drug as of Thursday, and arrested seven people during a series of raids. 
Meanwhile, residents of the neighbourhoods where the raids took place set tyres on fire and blocked a main road for the second day in a row.
The protesters allege that the police arrested innocent people with no connection to drug trafficking.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) STORYLINE: 
Cientos de migrantes se reunieron frente a la oficina de inmigración mexicana en Tapachula, ciudad fronteriza con Guatemala, para protestar contra las redadas policiales en pequeños hoteles y otros lugares de refugio donde se han alojado los migrantes. 
La ciudad se ha convertido en una estación de paso para migrantes procedentes de Centroamérica, Haití, Cuba y otros lugares, ya que México exige que muchas personas soliciten allí el estatus de refugiado o de asilo. 
Ya se han producido redadas anteriormente, pero esta semana los activistas afirman que los agentes retiraron a las personas de las aceras fuera de los refugios para migrantes. 
Muchos son devueltos a la fuerza a sus países de origen. 
Los agentes tienen prohibido entrar en los refugios para detener a la gente, pero muchos migrantes han acampado alrededor de las instalaciones superpobladas. 
El migrante salvadoreño Mario Guzmán fue detenido por agentes de inmigración hace unas semanas en el parque central de Tapachula, a pesar de que tenía documentos que demostraban que había solicitado asilo. 
SOUNDBITE: Mario Guzmán, Migrante de El Salvador 
Nos detuvieron y decían que eso no valía, dijeron que esos papeles no servían, que eso era falsos, vinieron y lo rompieron, dijo Guzmán, que fue retenido durante tres semanas en un centro de detención de inmigrantes y le dieron dos semanas para salir de México. 
Un grupo de unos 30 migrantes convocó una huelga de hambre para exigir a las autoridades que agilicen la expedición de papeles para poder salir de Tapachula. 
SOUNDBITE: Irineu Mujica, Activista de Pueblo sin Fronteras: 
Los compañeros, indefinidamente o lo que el cuerpo aguante, lo que podamos aguantar, yo por lo pronto vamos de día en día. . 
El instituto de inmigración dijo el lunes que 16.740 migrantes, principalmente de América Central, fueron detenidos en enero, en comparación con 9.406 en el mismo mes del año pasado, un aumento de 78%. 
Los niños y jóvenes menores de 18 años constituyeron el 14,5% de los migrantes detenidos, y un total de 780 no estaban acompañados por familiares, dijo la agencia.

Thousands of women took the streets of the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo on Friday, to protest against a rape case that has shocked the country.
In the incident, which occurred on Sunday, a woman left a club with a man and accompanied him to his apartment.
While they were having sexual intercourse, at least two more men entered the apartment and raped her. 
The unidentified 30-year-old was later found by a friend in the center of Montevideo and taken to a hospital where doctors confirmed the attack. 
Tamara García Sánchez, spokeswoman of Feminist Articulation, said they were protesting in rage over this specific case, but also all other acts of violence. 
Protesters marched along the streets from Independencia Square in downtown Montevideo.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) A funeral was held Saturday for the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a week after the renowned Zen master died at the age of 95 in Hue in central Vietnam.
Thousands of monks and disciples trailed a procession of pallbearers carrying Nhat Hanh's coffin from Tu Hieu Pagoda, where he spent his last days, to the cremation site. 
Others kneeled and clasped their hands in prayer on the roadside and bowed to the ground as the casket went past.
Nhat Hanh was globally recognized for helping spread the practice of mindfulness in the West and socially engaged Buddhism in the East.
Born Nguyen Dinh Lang in 1926 in Hue and ordained at the age of 16, Nhat Hanh distilled Buddhist teachings on compassion and suffering into easily grasped guidance over a lifetime dedicated to working for peace.
He founded the Plum Village Tradition, a practice of the art of mindful living, and gained a significant number of followers worldwide.
During the seven-day wake, Nhat Hanh was laid in state in Tu Hieu Pagoda's full moon reception hall, where his disciples came to pay respect in silence and practice meditation as a tribute to his teachings.
I am happy and feel at peace that I could come to Hue to say farewell and meditate with 'Su Ong' for the last time, said Do Minh Hieu, a follower of Nhat Hanh's who traveled from Ho Chi Minh City with his family for the funeral. 
Su Ong is an affectionate Vietnamese term meaning Grandpa Monk.
Su Ong has passed away but he's not gone. He stays with us in every walk, every breath, in our meditation, said another follower, Xuan Dung. 
He lives in flowers, in leaves, in the clouds and in our mindful practices.
According to his wishes, Nhat Hanh will be cremated and his ashes will be scattered at Plum Village centers and monasteries around the world.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN:
The head of the Taliban religious police in one of Afghanistan's provinces says that his units will not disrespect people. But as the force sets up checkpoints on main roads, some Afghans worry that they could return to the harsh tactics of previous years.

STORY-LINE:
Since the Taliban overran Kabul in August last year and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will reimpose their brutal rule of late 1990s.
The Taliban say that this time around their tactics are different. They say their religious police will only go out to talk to people.
In Herat, the capital of the province by the same name, Taliban policemen have been setting up checkpoints. In some cases, they are advising people to comply with Islamic law.
The director of the Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice department in Herat maintains that his forces will not force people to change their lifestyles.
We have not ordered or allowed anyone to search people's phones or check their hairstyles, or disrespect anyone, says Sheikh Aziz-u-Rahman.
The agency is tasked with ensuring people observe the Islamic codes. Saudi Arabia has a similar body.
It is also part of a ministry with the same name, set up by Taliban in the building that once housed the Women's Affairs Ministry.
During the Taliban's previous rule, the ministry was known for implementing a very harsh interpretation of Islamic law.
Taliban police used to patrol in vehicles and punish any individual who was caught committing what they considered a crime. 
Men were not allowed cut their beards and any type of music playing was banned.
The Taliban also denied girls and women an education and barred them from public life. They required women to wear a full veil covering the body and face.
While Taliban insist they will respect women's rights this time, Afghan women still face many restrictions. The Taliban have barred them from working outside the home in some areas.
Women's rights activist Fatima Farahi, who lived under the rule of Taliban from 1996 to 1999, still remembers the fear and anxiety people used to experience.
She's worried that more people will leave Afghanistan if more restrictions are imposed on them.
The country is already facing an economic collapse, and many businesses are closed.
Hairdresser Mohammad Naser is one of many barbershop owners worried about losing their businesses.
If extreme rules are implemented and people are not allowed to cut their beards or style their hair, we will suffer a great loss, Naser says, adding that he had already lost some clients.
The Taliban are facing major economic and security problems as they attempt to govern, and a growing challenge by Islamic State militants is further stretching their resources.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Former Sandinista rebel commander Dora María Téllez, one of dozens of political detainees rounded up last year by Nicaragua's government, was convicted after a trial lasting only a few hours, a lawyers group said Thursday.
Téllez, 65, led an assault on the National Palace in 1978 during the Somoza family dictatorship, holding congress members hostage in exchange for the release of rebel prisoners.
Following Anastasio Somoza's overthrow the next year, Téllez served as health minister in the first Sandinista government, which was led by Daniel Ortega from 1979 to 1990.
She later split with Ortega and became a leader of the opposition Sandinista Renovation Movement.
The former leader of that movement, Ana Margarita Vijil, was found guilty of the same charge in a similar trial Wednesday.
Ana Lucía Álvarez, Vijil's niece, said they are not facing judges or prosecutors at the service of the citizenry here, but but political operators of the dictatorship.
Álvarez' sister Támara Dávila is also in prison and awaiting trial.
Activists Yader Parajón and Jaser Vado were found guilty on Tuesday and sentenced to 12 years each.
Parajón's older brother Jimmy was killed in a protest during the 2018 social uprising.
Also convicted Thursday was former student protest leader Lesther Alemán.
Alemán became known in 2018 for challenging Ortega during a national dialogue convened during the social uprising.
The Judicial Defense Unit, a coalition of lawyers, said trials were held in the infamous Chipote prison, where 39 of the political opponents of President Daniel Ortega have been held for months.
Seven others are under a form of house arrest. 
The ruling Sandinista Front and its allies control Nicaragua's congress and all government institutions.
After leading the revolutionary government, Ortega served as president from 1985 to 1990, before being re-elected to power in 2007.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) As the Winter Olympics opening ceremony began on Friday, 63-year old Liu Wenbin was just one of many excited Beijing residents watching the event on television. 
It didn't matter if Beijing had just held the Games 14 years ago, or that the country had to artificially construct snow, or that the U.S. along with several other Western countries were staging a diplomatic boycott.
Many Chinese were filled with pride, like Liu, who filmed the opening ceremony on his phone as he watched in his home in western Beijing. 
As a Chinese person, I feel incomparably proud, Liu said. Our great China really is no. 1, even when the pandemic is so severe, we're still able to hold this international event, the Winter Olympics. 
Liu, a retiree from Beijing, was unable to see the event up close this year as tickets were only available to select groups owing to pandemic prevention measures. 
In 2008, he was too busy at work to be able to snag tickets to the Games, he said with some regret. The Chinese government, in hosting the Winter Olympics, has actively promoted winter sports, and that has successfully spread to some of its population.
Liu, who is from Beijing, said he sometimes takes his grandson to go skiing or skating. The family even went to Zhangjiakou, where part of the competition will be held, to see the ski trails, made with artificial snow from an intricate irrigation project. 
And all the fervor and controversy abroad didn't bother him in the slightest. 
I think some countries are biased, and that's very natural, he said of the diplomatic boycott. When you are living well, of course there will be someone who's jealous.
The U.S., Britain and others did not send officials in protest over China’s human rights abuses and its treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Fireworks lit up the Beijing skyline as China launched a locked-down Winter Olympics on Friday.
  
The opening ceremony began just after the arrival of Chinese President Xi Jinping and International Olympic Committee President Thomas Bach at the same lattice-encased National Stadium that hosted the inaugural event at the 2008 Olympics.
  
With the dimming of the lights, Beijing became the first city to host both winter and summer Games
The Olympics - and the opening ceremony - are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world and flaunt its best side.

Authorities say there were minor injuries from the collapse but no fatalities. 
Police reported the span, on Forbes Avenue over Fern Hollow Creek in Frick Park, came down just before 7 a.m.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) The landlord of Syrian house destroyed in U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Thursday said he was shocked by his tenant's identity.
Musab al-Sheikh thought he had rented his house to a displaced car dealer from the northern province of Aleppo and had no idea that the leader of the Islamic State group was living in the three-storey house he owns in the northwestern Syrian town of Atmeh. 
The man, who is believed to have been a top aide to IS leader, always paid on time during the time he stayed in the house paying $130 a month. 
The man in his early 40s later said he wants to bring his sister to live on the top floor and she did.
No one knew that among the people who moved in was IS top leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, who was killed in a U.S. raid on the safehouse in Atmeh. 
President Joe Biden said al-Qurayshi had been responsible for major assault on a Syrian prison last month as well as genocide against the Yazidi people in Iraq in 2014.
When helicopters carrying some 50 U.S. commandos thumped onto the ground in Syria an hour after midnight, the raiders confronted a houseful of extremists and children.
Baby comforts were inside — a stuffed bunny, a blue plastic swing, a crib. So was the paraphernalia of violence - such as the bomb Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi is said by U.S. officials to have used to blow up himself, his family and perhaps others in his immediate proximity.
It was an audacious raid in an extremist stronghold of northwest Syria, months in the works and executed with the understanding that children might die as well as the hunted IS chief if the building's occupants did not get out when given the chance to leave.
The apparent suicide bombing came before or early in a two-hour gun battle Thursday. First responders said 13 people died, six of them children. No U.S. commandos were wounded, military officials said.
Over months of planning, U.S. intelligence first had to locate al-Qurayshi's whereabouts and understand his movements - or lack thereof. 
They concluded he rarely, if ever, left his family's third-floor quarters except to bathe on the building's roof. 
Anticipating that al-Qurayshi could well choose death by self-detonation if cornered by U.S. forces, U.S. officials commissioned an engineering study-from-afar of the three-storey, cinder-block building to see if it would collapse in that event and kill everyone inside.
They concluded that enough of the building was likely to survive such a blast to spare those not near him.
The Islamic State group, which once controlled most of the territory in Iraq and parts of Syria, has been attempting to regenerate, and staged its most ambitious operation in years when it seized a prison in northeast Syria last month holding at least 3,000 IS detainees.

2. Rescue crew grapples gear entangling whale  
ANNOTATION: A rescue team cut off about 140 feet of line and a plastic trawling buoy to free a young humpback whale off Maui on Wednesday. 
3. Rescue crew pulls up behind whale
ANNOTATION: Officials said the whale was in good condition but that the line wrapped around its tail had begun to cut into the animal's flesh.
4. Rescue crew frees whale from entangled gear ++MUTE++
ANNOTATION: The gear will be analyzed to determine its exact source. 
STORYLINE:
Federal officials say a yearling humpback whale off Hawaii has been freed from a life-threatening entanglement in mooring gear.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a rescue team cut off about 140 feet (43 meters) of line and a plastic trawling buoy when they freed the whale off Maui on Wednesday. 
The whale's tail and fins were wrapped in small-gauge line with the plastic buoy floating behind, the agency said in a statement. 
Officials said the whale was in good condition but that the line wrapped around its tail had begun to cut into the animal's flesh. The gear was of considerable weight, the agency said. 
The gear will be analyzed to determine its exact source. 
The animal's behavior was very evasive, and while it stayed near the surface, it maintained unusually rapid speeds, at times in excess of six knots, the agency said in a statement Thursday. 
Trained responders cut the gear off with a blade attached to a pole after getting close on an inflatable boat. It is a federal crime to approach a humpback whale and the team was working under under federal permit. 
Another humpback whale was spotted off Hawaii entangled in debris earlier this month.

New York - 4 February 2022
1. Sarah Palin outside courthouse
STORYLINE:
Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin is back in a New York City courtroom more than a week after her libel trial against The New York Times was postponed because she tested positive for COVID-19. 
The trial is a rare example of a jury deciding the validity of a persistent refrain from Palin and other Republicans: That a biased news media is willing to bend the truth to make conservatives look bad.

A coalition of groups, including people from Hong Kong, Tibet, and Uyghurs,  protested the opening of the 2022 Beijing Olympic Games at San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge Thursday, and urged people to not watch the games. 
There have been various protests in the San Francisco area against the Beijing Games. While some countries stated they would not send diplomats to the Olympics, the games are moving on. 
Since we can't really do much, so I want people to pledge not to watch the Olympic Games, said Lobsang Chodon of the San Francisco Regional Tibetan Youth Congress.
Another demonstrator urged athletes to decline the medals, calling them bloodshed medals.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) At least six people were gunned down on Friday night in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa, in what would be the first major killing since President Xiomara Castro took power.
The attack took place at around 8 p.m. local time, when unknown individuals, heavily armed and dressed in military uniforms, began shooting in sector two of the Villanueva neighborhood.
At least six people died at the scene: five men in the street and one woman inside a house. 
Police officers reported that the criminals fled the area after the attack, but minutes later, they were intercepted by officers who engaged them in a gun battle.
Police captured two men dressed as soldiers of the Armed Forces, who are presumed to be members of gangs operating in Tegucigalpa.  
The killings add to the national death toll of victims of the high level of insecurity in the Central American nation.
High unemployment, persistent violence, corruption as well as troubled health care and educational systems are just some of the pressing challenges awaiting Castro, who was sworn in on Thursday.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) A bridge spanning a ravine collapsed in Pittsburgh, requiring rescuers to rappel nearly 150 feet while others formed a human chain to help rescue multiple people from a bus. 
The collapse early Friday came hours before President Joe Biden was to visit the city to promote his $1 trillion infrastructure bill, which includes bridge maintenance. 
Authorities say there were minor injuries from the collapse but no fatalities. 
Police reported the span, on Forbes Avenue over Fern Hollow Creek in Frick Park, came down just before 7 a.m. 
A commuter bus fell along with the bridge when it collapsed.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) The first group of Ukrainian soldiers took part in military exercises Friday using anti-tank missile systems received from the UK. 
The training consisted of three days of theory and tactics practice followed by two days of practical exercises for the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW).
Servicemen fired at targets at a distance of 300 to 600 metres from various positions.
The last stage of the drills took place in the International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security of the National Academy of Ukrainian Land Forces in the Lviv region. 
About 40 future NLAW instructors received certificates after the five-day course was over. 
They will be dispersed to military divisions to train new specialists.
According to the instructors, NLAWs can be operated by one person and their accuracy allows a user to hit the target in any weather. 
Russia's top diplomat said Friday that Moscow will not start a war in Ukraine but warned that it wouldn't allow the West to trample on its security interests, amid fears it is planning to invade its neighbor.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) President Joe Biden's commitment to nominating the U.S. Supreme Court's first Black female justice is an important step in addressing issues of gender, race and civil rights, legal experts say. 
Judith Browne Dianis, Executive Director of the Advancement Project, a racial justice organization, says that it is important to have a someone who has the lived experience of being a Black woman interpret constitutional law and make decision on the nation's highest court. 
Having a Back woman on the Supreme Court is exciting, the idea of it, because finally, we will not only have someone who will bring the experience of being Black in America, but someone who has lived at the intersections of race and gender. And hopefully will be a person who understands how race and gender have played in the law, she said. 
She said that while some have already criticized Biden's decision to appoint a Black female justice, she responds saying what is actually racist is that a Black woman has not sat on the Supreme Court since its inception. 
She also said that the current nomination is an opportunity for the legal profession to have more discussions about the term 'qualified.'
Dianis said the qualifications that have been used in the past are based on a career pathway that has been reserved for white men traditionally and some white women. T
There are very few people of color and Black people who have that pathway because there is a lot of discrimination that happens along the way, she said.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4363527

When Markicia Horton, 25, graduates this spring from the Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law in Houston and takes the bar, she'll be stepping into a world where a Black woman is set to be on the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time in its 232-year history.
With Stephen Breyer's retirement from the court and President Joe Biden's commitment to name a Black woman as his nominee, it is likely that as Horton moves into a profession, there will be a Black woman as a Supreme Court justice. What that means for her and thousands of other young women of color in law schools or serving as lawyers around the country is incalculable. 
But it comes as well, with concerns. According to the National Association for Law Placement, Black women made up 3.17 percent of associates at America's law firms in 2021 but less than 1 percent of partners. Women of color overall made up nearly 16 percent of associates at America's law firms but only about 4 percent of the partners.
I think that seeing the abortion cases presented before the Supreme Court and having another woman there essentially and having an African-American woman who can speak for the culture essentially as well as Americans as a whole, but just to give a different opinion, Horton says.
That, Horton said, is what a Black woman on the Supreme Court will bring to the table.
Her point of view at the Houston school is one shared more than 1,100 miles away at the North Carolina Central University School of Law where Professor Brenda Reddix-Smalls raised the issue during a Zoom session of the constitutional law course she teaches.
In North Carolina, examples of prominent Black female jurists include current state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls, who has been suggested as someone Biden could consider for the vacancy created by Breyer, and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination in the state's U.S. Senate race. Beasley was the first Black woman to oversee North Carolina's judicial branch. 
After the class ended, several students lingered to ask questions about assignments, and talk turned back to Biden's upcoming pick. Adaora Oguno, a 28-year old second-year student from Nashville, Tennessee, said that Biden's pick will fill a century's old vacancy that has left issues specific to Black women unaddressed.  
This is our moment, says Chazle' Woodley, student body president at North Carolina Central University School of Law. I'm excited, especially for the women who have been putting in work.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Through tears, the wife, Dominique Luzuriaga, of slain police officer Jason Rivera, 22, recalled the horror of seeing cellphone alerts about two officers being shot in Harlem. 
Her worries grew as she texted and called the former elementary school classmate she married this past October. 
She got no answer until the call that summoned her to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.
Luzuriaga made the comments while speaking Friday morning at her husband's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral.
Authorities are still investigating what motivated the gunman, who was shot by a third officer and later died.
Luzuriaga lashed out at new Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who has instructed prosecutors not to pursue certain cases, including some allegations of resisting arrest.
The system continues to fail us. We are not safe anymore. Not even the members of the service, Luzuriaga said.
Bragg, who had no involvement with the officers' killer, responded in a statement that he was grieving and praying for the slain officers and will vigorously prosecute cases of violence against police.
Rivera was barely into his second year on the force. He and Officer Wilbert Mora were fatally wounded a week ago when a gunman ambushed them in an apartment as they responded to a family dispute.
Police filled the pews at St. Patrick's Cathedral Friday, and a sea of blue uniforms stretched for blocks as snow drifted outside the city's iconic church.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) The opening ceremony for the Beijing Winter Olympics ended with a barrage of fireworks, marking the start of the Games under heavy virus restrictions.
  
The ceremony ended with the lighting of the torch on a large spinning snowflake, after which torchbearers brought the flame to a cauldron outside the National Stadium. 
With the dimming of the lights, Beijing became the first city to host both Winter and Summer Games.
The Olympics - and the opening ceremony - are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world and flaunt its best side.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Ukrainian soldiers being trained by the U.S. military on Friday were taught how to use a weapon designed to destroy hardened bunkers - one of the munitions sent by the U.S. government to aid Kyiv amid increasing concern over Russian aggression against Ukraine. 
The training, which was open for jounalists to film, took place on the outskirts of Ukraine's western city Lviv. 
Speaking to journalists, Ukrainian millitary training chief Colonel Andriy Bestyuk praised the munition, saying it is capable of destroying structures where enemy might hide. 
This weapon will also stop armored objects - hit them, and if the battle is in an urbanized area, it will allow you to shoot down a structure behind which the enemy will hide, he said. 
There are growing calls in Washington for the United States to support a potential Ukrainian insurgency.
While Russia’s forces are larger and more powerful than Ukraine’s, an insurgency supported by U.S.-funded arms and training could deter a full-scale invasion.
Russia denies having plans for an offensive, but it demands promises from NATO to keep Ukraine out of the alliance, halt the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and to roll back NATO forces from Eastern Europe. 
NATO and the U.S. call those demands impossible.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Samba lovers from around the world have flocked to Brazil to learn how to gyrate and shake to the drum-driven rhythms of samba.
Many of these Carnival tourists attend classes at dozens of schools and academies in Rio and other cities around the country to prepare. 
Not even the worldwide COVID-19 pandemic was enough to dampen their enthusiasm for learning the dance with many still hoping they can show off their newly acquired skills when the carnival festivities kick off this coming April.
This year many will be disappointed by a truncated Carnival celebration, reduced in scope and size by the pandemic, with restrictions on mass gatherings and parades, for a few weeks this April.
Dozens of aspiring foreign samba dancers, some of them coming from as far away as New Caledonia, a French territory in the far South Pacific Ocean, Europe, Asia and the Americas, are attending classes at the Tiuiti Samba School located in the Historic District of Rio.
For many this is the dream of a lifetime and not being able to participate because of the changes makes it all the more difficult to accept.
I have to go back to work, so I can't be at the Carnival this year, said Simone Carl, a German samba dance student taking classes at the Paraiso do Tiuiti Samba School while vacationing in Rio. 
I'll just watch it on TV back home in Germany.

      <description><![CDATA[(3 Feb 2022) House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she supports using sanctions against Russians if they invade, Ukraine, which she says would provide maximum leverage . 
This is deadly serious, Pelosi said, adding that the Russians have to feel the pain right up to the richest man in the world, Vladimir Putin. 
While some senators have advocated putting in sanctions in place against Russia prior to any potential invasion, Pelosi said she prefers sanctions be enacted after if they invade Ukraine. 
As the 2022 Winter Olympics  begin in China, Pelosi reiterated her support of athletes competing there but supported a a diplomatic boycott.
Led by the United States, a number of Western democratic countries are staging a diplomatic boycott of the Games to protest what the U.S. and human-rights groups have called the genocide  of some 1 million Uyghurs in China's far western Xinjiang province.

There have been various protests in the San Francisco area against the Beijing Games. While some countries stated they would not send diplomats to the Olympics, the games are moving on.
Since we can't really do much, so I want people to pledge not to watch the Olympic Games, said Lobsang Chodon of the San Francisco Regional Tibetan Youth Congress.
Another demonstrator urged athletes to decline the medals, calling them bloodshed medals.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Ford Motor Co. announced Friday that Google is joining the automaker's effort to transform a once-dilapidated Detroit train station into a research hub focused on electric and self-driving vehicles.
Also, officials said Detroit and the state of Michigan have agreed to provide infrastructure and other support for the Michigan Central Innovation District that will include the defunct train depot and other nearby buildings in the historic Corktown neighborhood just outside downtown.
Together, this is another sign that we are moving forward in a way that shows Michigan is in it to win, that we are going to lead in the mobility sector, that we are serious about developing high-tech and high-skilled jobs, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer said during an event inside the old train station. 
Ford announced plans for the Michigan Central Innovation District in 2018, shortly after it bought the 18-story, 500,000-square-foot (46,450-square-meter) train depot. Ford plans to research, test and launch new mobility solutions there.
The station, which looms over Corktown, has stood empty since the last train left in 1988 and came to symbolize Detroit's long decline from America's manufacturing powerhouse to its biggest municipal bankruptcy.
I was sick and tired of driving by this building all the time and having this be the poster child for the decay of Detroit, Bill Ford, executive chair of Ford Motor Co., told attendees at Friday's event. And I wanted to do something about that, and we're now, I think, very much in the process of turning this from a national punchline into a national treasure.
The state will provide more than $126 million worth of programming and resources, including infrastructure. The Dearborn, Michigan-based automaker said Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan's office is working to designate a Transportation Innovation Zone in the district, with the goal of making it easier for small businesses and entrepreneurs to safely start and test projects.
Google, which has more than 600 employees in Michigan, will open a lab on the 30-acre (12-hectare) site to teach computer science to high school students. Google's role includes a certification program.
Tragically, about 50 percent of high schools do not offer computer science training, said Ruth Porat, Google's chief financial officer. And what we'll be doing here is providing computer science training skills for high school kids after school, on weekends so that they too have access to one of these exciting new jobs of the future.
The auto industry as a whole is moving toward more fully electric and hybrid propulsion systems, more autonomous driving features and increased connectivity in vehicles.
Michigan Central Station opened in 1913 and for decades was a jewel of Detroit and hub of rail transportation into and out of the city. Detroit-made vehicles — along with air travel — proved part of its undoing.
Bill Ford has not said how much it cost to buy the train station from billionaire Manuel Matty Moroun or how much the automaker expects to spend fixing it up, though the company said that total investment is roughly $950 million for the station and surrounding district.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Hundreds of Tibetan exiles marched near the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Friday denouncing the Beijing Winter Olympics and demanding freedom for their region.
They waved Tibetan flags and held placards bearing messages like No Rights, No Games and Say No To Genocide Games. 
They demanded that China leave Tibet and implored the international community to stand up against Beijing.
The protesters burned the Chinese flag. 
Some were detained by police after they jumped over security barricades and tried to run toward the Chinese Embassy.
A large number of Tibetans have been living in exile in India since spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled Tibet after a failed uprising in 1959. 
China doesn't recognize the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile in India and accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking to separate Tibet from China.
Human rights groups have dubbed the Beijing Winter Olympics the genocide games, and the U.S. and other countries have cited rights abuses in leading a diplomatic boycott of the event.
China denies any human rights abuses, calling them the lie of the century.
Meanwhile, India won't be sending its top diplomat in Beijing to the Winter Olympics after the honor of carrying the Olympic torch went to a Chinese soldier who was wounded in a deadly border clash between the countries two years ago.

The White House insists President Joe Biden is looking forward to working with Republicans as he looks to nominate a replacement for retiring Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, but press secretary Jen Psaki warned Republicans not to play games by pre-emptively criticizing a potential Supreme Court nominee before she is even selected.
We have not mentioned a single name. We have not put out a list. The president made it very clear he has not made a selection and there are, if anyone is saying they plan to characterize whoever he nominates after thorough consideration with both parties as 'radical' before they knew literally anything about who she is, they just obliterated their own credibility, Psaki said.
Her comments came after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped Biden would not “outsource this important decision to the radical left.” 
Our intention is to not play games. The president's intention is to consult with members of both parties, and his intention is to nominate a qualified candidate who after after completing a rigorous process, who is worthy of the excellence and decency of Breyer's legacy, Psaki added.
The press secretary also dismissed those who suggest Biden's pledge to name black woman to the Supreme Court is an example of affirmative action.
It's been over 230 years, as we know, since the Supreme Court came into being. A black woman has never served on it. And the president's view is that anyone who's saying that that's not possible or we can't find the most eminently qualified person, that's ludicrous, Psaki said. 
The fact that no black woman has been nominated shows a deficiency of the past election processes, not a lack of qualified candidates to be nominated to the Supreme Court, she added.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) Thousands of women took the streets of the Uruguayan capital of Montevideo on Friday, to protest against a rape case that has shocked the country.
In the incident, which occurred on Sunday, a woman left a club with a man and accompanied him to his apartment.
While they were having sexual intercourse, at least two more men entered the apartment and raped her. 
The unidentified 30-year-old was later found by a friend in the center of Montevideo and taken to a hospital where doctors confirmed the attack. 
Tamara García Sánchez, spokeswoman of Feminist Articulation, said they were protesting in rage over this specific case, but also all other acts of violence. 
It happens to us women, who are queer, boys, girls, teenagers, even in their homes, García Sánchez said.
Protesters marched along the streets from Independencia Square in downtown Montevideo. 
Soledad Yerle, who joined Friday's protest, spoke about the culture of rape, in the society which has normalized rape.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Residents of Burkina Faso's capital Ouagadougou reacted on Friday to a speech given by their new military leader, Lt. Col. Paul Henri Sandaogo Damiba the night before. 
Damiba addressed the nation after mutinous soldiers forced democratically elected President Roch Marc Christian Kabore to resign this week, announcing they are now in charge of the West African country that's under siege by Islamic extremists.
The junta said Kabore failed to stem the jihadist violence that has killed thousands during his time in power. 
However, there are already new concerns that the coup could ultimately result in more attacks across Burkina Faso.
However, Young farmer Abdoul Aziz Compaore believed that if security comes back, it is up to us (Burkinabè) to see if we are going to make an electoral calendar or not.
That is to say, that if the elections are this year or next year, it is not a problem as long as the president does a good job, we can leave it, he explained.
Others welcomed the coup leader's promise of fighting terrorism and work to help thousands of internally displaced people go back to their homes. 
We hope that he succeeds in defeating terrorism and that everyone can return to their villages because when we see widows and orphans on the streets begging it is too sad, said hairdresser Kadi Ouedraogo. 
The international community has condemned the coup, despite widespread local support.  
On Friday the West African block ECOWAS, has decided to suspend Burkina Faso in the aftermath of this week's coup, making it the third nation in the regional bloc to be punished for a military takeover in only 18 months, following Mali and Guinea. 
In his first address to the nation since seizing power, Damiba said Thursday he was going to bring back security and order to the conflict-ridden nation, and unite the country. 
But he also warned that betrayal wouldn't be tolerated. 
Damiba, leader of the Patriotic Movement for Safeguarding and Restoration (MPSR), spoke from the presidential palace.
He explained that the country was facing an unprecedented crisis and the junta's priority would be to restore security by renewing the will to fight among its soldiers and by listening to people to form a path forward.  
Damiba also called on the international community not to turn its back on Burkina Faso.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) People from New York City to Maine awakened Saturday to half a foot (15 centimeters) of snow, and forecasters warned that could more than quadruple as a powerful nor’easter kicked up blinding blizzard conditions with high winds and the potential for widespread power outages and coastal flooding.
Parts of 10 states and some major population centers - Philadelphia, New York and Boston - were in the path of the storm, which was expected to rage throughout the day. 
Airlines canceled more than 4,500 flights at some of the nation’s busiest airports, according to FlightAware. Amtrak suspended or limited service on the Boston-to-Washington corridor.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) The head of a US Congressional delegation to Kyiv claimed on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had united his adversaries amid the threat of conflict in Ukraine.
He's united the EU, he's united the NATO members, he's united the Ukrainian people and he's united the United States Congress, said Gregory Meeks.
The representatives, headed by Meeks, are on a visit to Kyiv to meet with senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
While there are no plans and no desires for American boots on the ground here, we must do all that we can short of that to help the Ukrainians, said Republican Mark Green.
Democrat Tom Malinowski added that the sanctions that we have prepared will be absolutely devastating and they will be imposed should he (Vladimir Putin) move, and he knows it.
Russia said Friday it will not start a war in Ukraine but warned that the US and NATO have ignored its demands and left little room for compromise in the crisis.
Putin told French President Emmanuel Macron the West has failed to consider Russia’s key conditions of halting further NATO expansion, stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near Russian borders, and rolling back its forces from Eastern Europe, the Kremlin said.
The US and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war amid the buildup of more than 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine.
Russia has repeatedly denied having any plans to invade its neighbor.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4364436

An important ecological reserve in Tierra del Fuego archipelago in southern Chile is under threat from forest fires which have already devastated more than 1,200 hectares close to the area.
The blaze, which started on 25 January, threatens the Karukinka Natural Park, an area of precious ecosystems and biodiversity.
The fire has reached Forestal Russfin forests bordering the park.
On Thursday, Emilia Undurraga, Chile's agriculture minister, traveled to the region to monitor firefighting efforts.
National Forest Corporation team members are coordinating the fire control operation.
Felipe Valencia, incident fire commander, said the blaze was spreading faster than usual because of a particular type of oak tree found in the area.
He said it produced the heaviest combustion that can exist, causing the flames to spread horizontally and vertically at the same time.
Karukinka Natural Park is an ancestral territory of the native Selk'nam people in Patagonia, one of the world's best-preserved southernmost forests.

      <description><![CDATA[(3 Feb 2022) Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is calling for sanctions against Russia and its leaders, including with President Vladimir Putin to deter any agression toward Ukraine. 
I'm hopeful in the next coming days, we can introduce a sanctions package that imposes sanctions now for the provocation with post invasion sanctions that will destroy the Russian economy as we know it.
U.S. intelligence and defense officials held classified briefings on Capitol Hill Thursday separately to both Senate and House members about the situation in Ukraine. 
Democrats and Republicans said there is bipartisan support to act against Russian aggression toward Ukraine. 
Russia has amassed more than 100,000 troops near Ukraine’s northern and eastern borders, raising concern that Moscow might invade again, as it did in 2014. 
The troop presence and uncertainty have unnerved Ukrainians and hurt the country’s economy. 
Russian officials deny that an invasion is planned.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) As of Friday, customers eating inside bars and restaurants and going to fitness centres in the city of Barcelona are no longer required to present COVID-19 passports upon entrance.  
Another restriction no longer in place is the limit of up to ten people during private gatherings.  
But nightlife businesses will remain closed until further notice, regional authorities said Tuesday. 
With one of Europe's highest vaccination rates, the Spanish government is laying the groundwork to treat the next infection surge not as an emergency but an illness that is here to stay.  
The idea is to move from crisis mode to control mode, approaching the virus in much the same way countries deal with flu or measles.   
That means accepting that infections will occur and providing extra care for at-risk people and patients with complications.  
A spike in new daily infections in December due to the omicron variant forced regional Catalan authorities to reinstate a night curfew during the Christmas holidays.   
The curfew was extended a further two weeks but lifted January 21.  
Other restrictions remain in place, such as wearing face masks outdoors.   
Officials credited the draconian measures with preventing a full collapse of the health system.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) GUNS N' ROSES FRONTMAN AXL ROSE TURNS 60
Axl Rose, the bandana-wearing singer of rock band Guns N' Roses, turns 60-years-old on Sunday (6 FEBRUARY 2022).
Born in Lafayette, Indiana on 6 February 1962, Rose shook up the pop and dance-dominated music scene of the 1980s along with bandmates Slash and Izzy Stradlin on guitars, plus bassist Duff McKagan and Steven Adler on drums.
Over the years, the band built a reputation as one of rock's most exciting but controversial acts.
The official Guns N' Roses debut Appetite for Destruction was released in 1987, and included hits Welcome to the Jungle, Paradise City and Sweet Child O' Mine. The album spent five non-consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200. The group went on to release EP G N' R Lies and the double album Use Your Illusion I and Use Your Illusion II - earning three Grammy nominations.
But there was also dysfunction within the band, and criticism of some lyrics as racist and homophobic.
Slash and McKagan created an uproar in 1990 when they accepted honors at the American Music Awards with obscenity-laced speeches. Rose was accused of sparking a riot in 1991, when lunged at a fan with a video camera during a concert, and then stopped the show.
The band members went their separate ways in 1993 - an acrimonious split followed by a well documented feud, with Slash and Rose not speaking for many years.
After the breakup, Rose fronted a new line up of the group, releasing the album Chinese Democracy in 2008. In 2016, he stepped in to sing for AC/DC on stage, when Brian Johnson was given medical advice to stop touring.
The same year, Rose reunited with Slash and McKagan for the first time in 23 years, to begin their hit  Not In This Lifetime Tour.

Sarah Palin's libel suit against The New York Times went to trial Thursday in a case over the former Alaska governor's claims the newspaper damaged her reputation with an editorial linking her campaign rhetoric to a mass shooting.
The trial is a rare example of a jury deciding the validity of a persistent refrain from Palin and other Republicans: That a biased news media is willing to bend the truth to make conservatives look bad.
Palin, a onetime Republican vice presidential nominee, told journalists as she arrived at the courthouse that she was looking for Justice for people who expect truth in the media.
A lawyer for The Times, David Axelrod, told jurors the editorial was primarily about gun laws, not Palin, and was not a political hit job.
Opening statements to the jury were initially scheduled for last week, but were postponed when Palin tested positive for COVID-19.
Palin will be the trial's star witness. She's seeking unspecified damages.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Enthusiastic fans are flocking to collect merchandise and souvenirs from the Beijing Winter Olympics. 
In a 20 square meter (215 sq ft) room deep in an alleyway in the Chinese capital, 35-year-old Zhang Wenquan keeps around 5,000 Olympic souvenirs - mascots, flags, torches and pins.
He's collected the assorted items from around the world - Beijing, Sochi, Munich, Pyeongchang - since the last Beijing Games in 2008. 
Zhang said he's felt a special connection with the Olympics ever since he worked as a volunteer in 2008, delivering score cards.
He claims to have invested over 500,000 RMB (78,600 US dollars) in his hobby. 
I check online about every hour and see if there is new Olympic souvenir released, said Zhang. My life has been filled with the Olympics.
Though eager to be part of the Winter Games scheduled to open Friday, Zhang couldn't be a volunteer or buy a ticket for the opening ceremony, due to strict coronavirus measures. 
I have been trying so hard to watch it at the scene, but because of the epidemic, there may be no chance, he said.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) The dissident Chinese artist behind the giant lattice-style Bird's Nest venue in Beijing that was hosting Friday's opening ceremonies of the Winter Games had tough words for China's government and others that kowtow to it.
Ai Weiwei mocked what he called the Chinese government's excessive and ineffectual lockdown measures to fight COVID-19, and its poor human rights record – saying hopes that it might have improved since Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Games have gone unfulfilled.
I think it's really, really unbelievable after 14 years of this -- this game, same game -- we turn to the same country, a country (that has) not developed an inch towards better human rights and the better freedom of speech conditions, but rather become very arrogant, he told the Associated Press in an interview by video conference.
The Chinese dissident widely regarded as one of the world’s greatest living artists has repeatedly described the 2008 Olympics as a “fake smile” that his native country presented to the world.
Ai Weiwei also took aim at the International Olympic Committee, saying the Winter Games means big business for them. 
He faulted the IOC, saying it never protected human rights and has shown itself to always defend … whatever China is doing – and which is a pity.
He chuckled derisively when told about a tweet from World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who tweeted a photo of himself in a red-and-white Beijing 2022 winter track suit and matching wool cap as he carried the Olympic flame during the torch relay in China.
Under Tedros, the U.N. health agency came in for severe criticism from then-U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in 2020 for its alleged missteps and excessive deference to and praise for China when the COVID-19 pandemic first appeared in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding some two years ago.
He should get a gold medal from China because he never asked the right question. Ai Weiwei quipped. 
Where is his conscience, this guy? You know, all those people who are supposed to defend the human health and give the right information, but never ask the right question and always on the side of the propaganda, he said.
They're so ridiculous, Ai Weiwei  added.
The artist didn't give a pass to other countries either – both those like Russia, which were represented at the highest official levels, and some Western countries who boycotted the Games or decided to stay away for reasons like COVID-19 concerns, faulting them for a double-standard.
They very, like, softly say, 'we are not officially attending'. For me, that is like a joke, AI Weiwei said. 
So the West -- the problem is, cannot find a better strategy -- but to use that as like a smoke gun to say, 'OK, we're defending those principles.'
But in the reality, they are not: They are business as normal, he added.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN:
Forced to leave their homeland after the Taliban seized power, two young Afghan women have opened a restaurant in the Albanian coast city of Shengjin.
By serving Afghan dishes to the around 1,000 refugees now staying in the coastal town, the two women hope to provide a welcome taste of home.

STORY-LINE:
Visiting a local supermarket in the Albanian coastal town of Shengjin, 22-year-old Walwala Jalalzay and 19-year-old Maryam Aslami are searching for ingredients.
The two young Afghan refugees have opened a restaurant called Kabul-Shengjin. The idea is to bring the taste of home to the around 1,000 Afghan refugees now staying in the city.
They use the few Albanian words they've managed to learn during their three-month stay to order the goods they desire.
At first, when we were coming here, we were using some body language to describe what do we want, says Jalalzay.
Slowly, we are learning names, and we are learning things that we want, and we know the places that where is the location of something, where is the position of something that we can use.
Back at the restaurant, to the sound of music from their motherland, they open the eatery every day. 
Maryam's two sisters also help make food and serve the customers. 
When we came here, obviously, we missed our country, we missed our people, we missed the environment, we missed our parents back behind, but we cannot go back to our country, and maybe they cannot come in here. So, the only thing now that we can do is to bring the taste of the foods in here, says Jalalzay.
We decided to open the restaurant to bring the taste of home in here.
The restaurant has become an attraction for locals hoping to sample Afghan food.
We found the dishes very interesting. It is the first time we tried (Afghan food), says local Sonila Islamaj.
Albania has sheltered thousands of Afghan evacuees in hotels or tourist resorts. 
The Balkan country was one of the first to offer to host up to 4,000 Afghan refugees.
But Jalalzay doesn't intend to stay here. She's waiting on clearance to travel to the United States and join her brothers who are both living in Virginia.
She doesn't know how long she'll stay in Shengjin but knowing the situation in her home country - especially when it comes to women's rights - she feels blessed for have found her way to Albania.
Since their return to power, the Taliban have imposed widespread restrictions, many of them directed at women.
Disappointed with what's happening back in her home country, Jalalzay still hopes things will get better.
We hope they (Taliban) stand up on their promises that they have given, she says.
At the first, they said they will let girls and ladies to have their rights, to be educated, to go out. So, now we are seeing they are doing the opposite of what they say. So, I just hope the situation gets better soon.
The Taliban's sweep to power in Afghanistan in August drove billions of dollars in international assistance out of the country and sent an already dirt-poor nation, ravaged by war, drought and floods, spiraling toward a humanitarian catastrophe. 
It's estimated that roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan's 38 million people are dependent on aid and the U.N. says nearly 3 million are displaced in their own country, driven from their homes by drought, war and famine.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Families played games and danced at a government-run sports-themed plaza in Beijing on Friday in anticipation of the opening of the 2022 Winter Olympics.
Even if the Olympics are being held with strict COVID-19 prevention measures, with spectators being asked to clap instead of cheer, there was still a festive air in the capital city.
At the Winter Olympics Culture Plaza in Beijing, neighborhood dance troupes performed as families gathered to join in the excitement.
I hope that that our athletes do well, and together show the world our future, said Liu Jingyun, who was part of a group of dancers.
Her team of dancers had already started preparing to welcome the Games four years ago by decorating the flat taiping drums they performed with snowflakes.
Another group swirled through the plaza on rollerblades, wearing matching red and white outfits and helmets.
Because Beijing is a dual-Olympic city, we are incomparably proud and excited that Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics, said rollerblader Qiang Junxian.
Much of the event was staffed by volunteers like Zhang Xinrui, a college senior.
This Winter Olympics, it's like an international festival, and as a volunteer, it's a hugely important thing for me as a college student, and even in my life, Zhang said.
The Chinese government, in hosting the Winter Olympics, has actively promoted winter sports, and that has successfully spread to some of its population.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Argentina has reached an agreement with the International Monetary Fund to refinance more than $40 billion in debt, President Alberto Fernández said Friday.
Speaking at a news conference after the announcement Argentina's Economic Minister laid out some of the details of the agreement.
Argentina was able to reach a policy agreement with the International Monetary Fund without there being adjustment policies, stated Martin Guzman.
The exchange rate policy is going to continue along the lines in which it has been carried out and we set an objective of accumulation of international reserves, which is very important to favor resilience on the external front, he said.
Since 2020, Argentina has been in an arduous negotiation with the IMF to refinance the debt contracted in 2018 during the government of conservative Mauricio Macri in the midst of a currency crisis.
Argentina had spent three years trying to renegotiate repayment terms with the IMF and considered a deal vital to stabilizing an economy whose lengthy crisis has been hit as well by the pandemic.

Dominique Luzuriaga, the wife of slain NYPD police officer Jason Rivera, spoke at her husband's funeral on Friday. 
She lashed out at new Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who has instructed prosecutors not to pursue certain cases, including some allegations of resisting arrest.
Rivera and Officer Wilbert Mora were fatally wounded a week ago when a gunman ambushed them in an apartment as they responded to a family dispute.
Bragg, who had no involvement with the officers' killer, responded in a statement that he was grieving and praying for the slain officers and will vigorously prosecute cases of violence against police.

RESTRICTION SUMMARY:
STORYLINE:
ASSOCIATED PRESS
San Pablo - 27 de enero de 2022
La población sin hogar en la ciudad de San Pablo aumentó un 31 por ciento durante la pandemia de COVID-19, según datos de un nuevo censo.
Las autoridades registraron casi 32.000 personas viviendo en la calle. Cifra más elevada que la del resto de las ciudades del país.
Luiz Carlos da Silva fue uno de los que se quedó sin hogar durante la pandemia.
Desde septiembre del año pasado, duerme en una carpa improvisada en la acera con su esposa, embarazada de tres meses.
SOUNDBITE (Portugués) - Luiz Carlos da Silva, persona sin hogar:
Hasta el año pasado yo tenía una buena vida. Tenía mi casa, mis bienes, tenía todo, y mira dónde estoy ahora, dijo da Silva.
Otra familia sin un techo es la de Sheila Carvalho de Souza. Ella y sus cuatro hijos reciben donaciones de ropa y alimento de un residente local.
SOUNDBITE (Portugués) - Sheila Carvalho de Souza, persona sin hogar:
Hoy voy a comer carne porque recibí esta comida y hay mucha comida aquí, dijo de Souza, quien recoge artículos reciclables en las calles.
El censo se iba a realizar en 2023, pero el gobierno local lo adelantó debido a la escalada de pobreza agravada por la pandemia y la necesidad de generar proyectos para esta población.
Según el Instituto Brasileño de Geografía y Estadística, había 13,5 millones de personas desempleadas en el país en el tercer trimestre de 2021.

Enthusiastic fans are flocking to collect merchandise and souvenirs from the Beijing Winter Olympics.
In a 20 square meter (215 sq ft) room deep in an alleyway in the Chinese capital, 35-year-old Zhang Wenquan keeps around 5,000 Olympic souvenirs - mascots, flags, torches and pins.
He's collected the assorted items from around the world - Beijing, Sochi, Munich, Pyeongchang - since the last Beijing Games in 2008.
Zhang said he's felt a special connection with the Olympics ever since he worked as a volunteer in 2008, delivering score cards.
He claims to have invested over 500,000 RMB (78,600 US dollars) in his hobby.
Sometimes I wake up for auctions at 2 or 3 in the morning, said Zhang. My life has been filled with the Olympics.
Though eager to be part of the Winter Games scheduled to open Friday, Zhang couldn't be a volunteer or buy a ticket for the opening ceremony, due to strict coronavirus measures.
Meanwhile, hundreds of Beijing residents queued in front of a Beijing Olympics souvenir store for a chance to purchase memorabilia.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:
On the steep and narrow streets of an ancient city in Kosovo, bins are still collected by horse.
Where modern vehicles can't go, a bin collector and his horse continue to assure a public service.

STORY-LINE:
For the last four decades, the city of Prizren in Kosovo has had an unusual bin collecting duo: Nexhmedin Berisha, 66, and his horse. 
Five days a week, they go up and down the narrow cobbled streets of the old neighbourhood of Nenkala (Under castle), something which has turned them into local heroes.
No vehicles can climb the steep streets of this part of the city, located 85 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina.
Prizren, Kosovo's second most populous city, is on the banks of a river and features a fortress overlooking the city. 
The site has been used since the Bronze Age according to archaeological excavations. 
Berisha collects bin bags from each house in Nenkala, a neighbourhood often nicknamed quarter of the windows since houses were built so close to each other.
With the pandemic there have been many difficulties for people but this man has always come to our houses to collect waste. He is a successful, glorious man for the residents of this neighbourhood. It is very difficult for him, with the slopes but he still goes to take the waste, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been many people infected with the virus but he goes. We are very pleased, says Pash Moneka, a resident in Prizren's Nenkala quarter.
Local authorities are pleased with his work, which helps preserve the city's ancient site.
I've been doing this job for 44 years. Only the horse can pass through these streets. With my horse I collect the waste and have always continued to work, respecting the job, says Berisha, while holding his horse.
I have never stopped, regardless of the snow or the rain. I have never stopped working. Where the trucks can't go uphill I go with the horse. I have never had any obstacle from people. I am always ready, in death funerals or weddings, always trying to leave them (the people) satisfied. I have never had problems with them, now for 44 years.
And that's the most important thing to Berisha: continuity.
The reason why we are using a horse in these streets is because the trucks cannot go to this old part of Prizren. The paths are very narrow and only the horse may pass through them and that protects old Prizren, traditions of the old Prizren. We have always applied this form of service. Even during the pandemic, we have not stopped. We have done such a service five days per week, says Flamur Nomlexhiu from the waste management company of Eko Region.
Collecting the waste is not the only service which has turned Berisha into a local hero. 
His horse almost never climbs back empty - it  brings food and other goods Berisha buys at the city for the retired people up in his quarter.
Berisha is paid 210 Euros ($238) per month, just enough money to support himself.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) PIERRE CARDIN COLLECTION PAYS TRIBUTE TO LATE DESIGNER WITH SPACE AGE CONCEPT
It was fitting that Friday (28 JANUARY 2022) evening's homage to Pierre Cardin—a fashion show in his honor—took place at the Le Bourget Air and Space Museum, north of Paris. The iconic French designer is famous for his space age fashions going back to the 1960s. He passed away in December 2020, at age 98, but he was still designing up until the end.
The collection, Cosmocorps 3022, was shown outside, at the foot of an Ariane 5 European space launch vehicle. It was also livestreamed to audiences in Tirana, Moscow, Dallas, and Mexico, many of them young students in the fashion industry.
The show started with archival footage of the late designer and his creations on two giant screens. This was followed by 30 of the last looks designed by Cardin, realized in the Paris atelier. There were the bold pop colors, the mid-thigh trapeze dresses in stretchy fabrics, the unisex jumpsuits worthy of Star Trek, as well as exaggerated shoulders, cutouts and circular details, skinny futuristic sunglasses, and shiny black ankle boots. 
Part two represented the house's future, under the reins of Cardin's nephew, Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, the current CEO and artistic director. Working with three other designers from the studio, he created a collection for women and men that was still recognizably Cardin: two-tone jersey dresses in daring shades, such as red with magenta; stiff geometric shoulders and collars, colorful long capes for men. One dress featured a pair of brilliant pink hoops, like hula hoops. Others featured stiff disc-like shapes around the hips or torso. Metallic long evening gowns reflected the light. At the end, a woman dressed in white came out and danced like a whirling dervish, her skirt flaring as she moved.
After the show, Basilicati-Cardin said the company has had the most loyal staff, which contributed to its success and continuity.
In the house I have people who have been working for 60 years…they lived all their life with us. Which is something special, it is not normal. I have to maintain that.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) The town of Chebaa is used to snow in January but a recent storm, which has blanketed most of Lebanon, has left the town with snowfall the town hasn't been seen in a decade.
Snow trucks struggle to keep up with the amount of snow, leading many mountainous roads in Lebanon closed due to the weather.  
The roads are opening but that's not helping because the weather as you can see, a storm one right after the other. So the roads are staying closed so it has been hard to move around, said Mohammad Daher, a Chebaa resident.  
A winter storm has been battering the eastern Mediterranean, bringing heavy rains and wind to the Middle East this past week. 
Temperatures reached below 0 Celsius in some parts of the Middle East.
Lebanon, a country of 6 million people, is home to 1.5 million Syrian refugees and as Lebanon grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis, poverty has deepened the Lebanese people. 
Sky-rocketing fuel prices coupled with a currency collapse has meant many essential commodities, including fuel needed for heaters, are now out of reach for the average citizen.
For Dalal Moussa, the cold weather has isolated her in her home. 
A person can't even go outside to go get some fruits even. We can even check on each other. Nothing. There is no diesel. If someone has a little bit of diesel, he's using it lightly so that we can last the winter, she said. 
She turns off her heater at night to save on diesel and only stays warm in the coldest hours of the day with just blankets. 
And with no electricity, an electric heater is not a choice for many in Lebanon.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Portugal on Friday ended two weeks of political campaigning for national elections, coming amidst an omicron surge in the country. 
On Friday leader of the Social Democrats, the main opposition party, Rui Rio gathered hundreds of supporters in downtown Lisbon as a show of confidence ahead of Sunday's vote.
In recent days, polls have brought the two running candidates closer, with speculation that either Rio and current Prime Minister and Socialist leader Antonio Costa could win. 
The country's facing a snap election for a new parliament and government follows a political crisis caused when the minority government formed by the Socialists in 2019 collapsed last November, halfway through its four-year term, when parliament rejected its 2022 state budget.
The spending plan is key. 
Portugal, a country of 10.3 million people, is poised to begin deploying some 45 billion euros ($50.8 billion) in help from the EU to help fire up the economy after the COVID-19 pandemic.
The new funds are seen as a chance for Portugal to make up lost economic ground.
But the snap election, intended to clarify the country's direction, could backfire and leave Portugal back where it started two months ago - with a vulnerable minority government.
An apparent surge in support for smaller parties means the two main parties will likely have to cut a deal with one or more of them, with an extended period of political negotiation expected.
The country's two main parties, the center-left Socialists and the center-right Social Democrats, have alternated in power for decades, but Portugal's problems have continued. 
  
Those two parties have for decades collected around 70% of the vote, alternating in government, and opinion polls suggest a close race between them this time.
  
Portugal's economy has been falling behind the rest of the EU since 2000, when its real annual GDP per capita was 16,230 euros ($18,300) compared with an EU average of 22,460 ($25,330).
By 2020, Portugal had edged higher to 17,070 euros ($19,250) while the bloc's average surged to 26,380 euros ($29,750).
  
Sunday's ballot is taking place amid a surge in cases blamed on the highly infectious omicron coronavirus variant, with hundreds of thousands of infected people confined at home. 
To reconcile the constitutional right to vote and the duty to care for public health, authorities are allowing infected people to go to polling stations, with a recommendation they go in a less busy evening time slot.

RESTRICTION SUMMARY:
STORYLINE:
ASSOCIATED PRESS
Donetsk, Ucrania - 27 de enero de 2022
A medida que crece la tensión en la frontera entre Ucrania y Rusia, los residentes de un pueblo en las afueras de Donetsk esperan la paz.
Spartak, que todavía alberga a unas 80 familias, está cerca del frente del lado rebelde.
La mayoría de sus habitantes son personas mayores que rara vez salen a la calle, por temor a la amenaza de bombardeos.
SOUNDBITE (Ruso) - Valentina Pleshkovam, residente:
Solo esperamos que Rusia nos tome de una vez, porque esto tiene que detenerse en algún momento, dijo esta residente.
La tensión se ha disparado en las últimas semanas.
Estados Unidos y sus aliados de la OTAN temen un ataque de Moscú al ex estado soviético, por las tropas rusas desplegadas cerca de la frontera.
Rusia ha negado planes de invasión. 
SOUNDBITE (Ruso) - Irina (no dio apellido), residente:
Lo que está pasando ahora es no una guerra, es un fratricidio. Nosotros y Ucrania somos lo mismo, hemos sido lo mismo, dijo esta residente.
Mientras Moscú y Occidente evalúan sus próximos pasos, la OTAN dijo que estaba reforzando su disuasión en la región del Mar Báltico, y Estados Unidos ordenó a 8.500 soldados en alerta máxima.
Rusia ha lanzado una serie de ejercicios militares en el suroeste de su país, en Kaliningrado, en el Mar Báltico y en el Mar Negro y el Ártico.
Sus tropas también se dirigieron a Bielorrusia, lo que aumentó los temores de Occidente de que Moscú pudiera organizar un ataque contra Ucrania desde el norte.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Thousands of journalists from around the world were working under strict COVID-19 restrictions Friday at the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics. 
The opening ceremony is due to begin on Friday evening local time. 
Confined to a 'closed-loop' to prevent an outbreak of infections, journalists can only visit a limited number of sites and are not allowed to move freely through the Chinese capital.  
We feel here like we are in jail, said Viki Ivanovic, a senior reporter from Croatia's national broadcaster HRT. We can't go out of the hotel, police is outside, a big fence is there. I can't feel the Olympic spirit.
But other journalists said the restrictions were an important way to keep infection at bay, especially as the omicron variant continues to rage around the world. 
Organizers said nine more athletes and officials tested positive for COVID-19 on Thursday, raising the total to 111 since Jan. 23.
Seven cases were detected at the airport, and two came from daily PCR testing that all people inside the Olympic bubbles must undergo.
Organizers said 12 more positive cases were detected among stakeholders — mostly workers at the Games, including the press. Seven of those were at the airport and five were in daily tests.
The overall total of positive cases is 308 through Thursday. Almost 12,000 people have arrived in Beijing from outside China.

STORYLINE:
Federal officials say a yearling humpback whale off Hawaii has been freed from a life-threatening entanglement in mooring gear.
The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said a rescue team cut off about 140 feet (43 meters) of line and a plastic trawling buoy when they freed the whale off Maui on Wednesday. 
The whale's tail and fins were wrapped in small-gauge line with the plastic buoy floating behind, the agency said in a statement. 
Officials said the whale was in good condition but that the line wrapped around its tail had begun to cut into the animal's flesh. The gear was of considerable weight, the agency said. 
The gear will be analyzed to determine its exact source. 
The animal's behavior was very evasive, and while it stayed near the surface, it maintained unusually rapid speeds, at times in excess of six knots, the agency said in a statement Thursday. 
Trained responders cut the gear off with a blade attached to a pole after getting close on an inflatable boat. It is a federal crime to approach a humpback whale and the team was working under under federal permit. 
Another humpback whale was spotted of Hawaii earlier this month, also entangled in debris.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Forces of Yemen's internationally-recognized government have reclaimed large swathes of territory in a southern province from Iran-backed Houthi rebels, government officials said.
The Yemeni Armed Forces Media Centre stated on its official page on Twitter that the army forces, backed by the popular resistance, have liberated several sites from the Houthi militia control in the Mas front, northwest of Marib. 
The push in the southern province of Shabwa comes amid heavy airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis elsewhere in Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa.
The rebels have also stepped up their cross-border attacks, using ballistic missiles and explosive-laden drones to target Saudi Arabia.
Yemen's civil war began in 2014 when the Houthis took Sanaa and much of the northern part of the country, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.
The conflict has since become a regional proxy war that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and fighters.
Government troops, aided by fighters from the Giants Brigades militia, swept through Shabwa earlier this month, retaking most of the Usaylan district from the Houthis.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:
The traditional Chinese New Year celebrations in London have been scaled down once again because of the pandemic, but smaller events will go ahead.
The London Eye will light up in red and gold to welcome in the Year of the Tiger and restaurants will be open. But organisers are asking people not to come en mass to China Town. 

 STORY-LINE:
New lanterns for the Chinese New Year.
London's Chinatown is getting ready for it biggest event, but this year, festivities are being scaled  down due to the pandemic.
Usually, London's celebration of the Chinese New Year is the biggest outside of Asia. 
Basically, as you know, every year we have a parade, we have lots of performances in Trafalgar Square, half a million visitors come to London (pre-pandemic) and we're having Charing Cross Road and also Chinatown is all pedestrians spaces. And then we have five stages performing all different cultural activities and lots of people come over and we celebrate Chinese New Year together. But unfortunately, this year we have to scale down so much, says Lawrence Lee, Spokesperson for the London Chinatown Chinese Association.
For now, the London Chinatown Chinese Association, which organises the event, is busy putting up new lanterns.
So we are luckily having sponsorship from the local businesses and also some banks. So a lot of lanterns, they will bear their names on it. And so it's just to symbolise their sponsorship and their charitable means. And also this year, it's been all designed and made in China. And then we shipped them over, says Lee.
But the event is being planned to cater to a more local audience spread across the two weeks of the Spring Festival. 
For the organisers, it's a difficult balance to strike: attract visitors, but not too many.
We have to protect the general public. We don't stop to encourage people to come in masses, you know, to celebrate together, and they will be able to see our programmes on TV. And I do hope that people don't all rush into Chinatown because they can easily come and celebrate in the future. And because the Chinese New Year lasts for two weeks. So they can always come along and have some nice food and celebrate with us, says Lee. 
A market will be held from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. in Chinatown on Monday (31 January). The London Eye will also light up in red and gold colours.
Laura Citron, CEO of London and Partners says people still can to come to London to enjoy the Chinese restaurants and shops over the New Year celebrations.  
We're really excited about Chinese New Year in London this year. We won't be having the big festivities on Trafalgar Square that we've had in previous years for obvious reasons. But we're having a fantastic night market here in Chinatown behind me and our Chinese community is going to be celebrating and all of our favourite Chinese restaurants and shops will be open. So I think we're all really looking forward as Londoners to coming out celebrating Chinese New Year. 
Most people are expected to mark the occasion in a more intimate and private setting, most likely at home.
It's the case of Laiyuen Choi, a Londoner from China.
I'm going to have a dinner with my friends in a house. So we're probably going to have a hodgepodge, obviously. And we're going to play some games or something like that, says Choi.
Restaurants and supermarkets are stocking up to face the peak of demand early next week, but not anywhere near the same quantities they used to order pre-pandemic.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Sri Lanka celebrated its 74th Independence Day from the UK with a state ceremony presided over by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
This year's Independence Day ceremony is being held in keeping with the health guidelines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation. The event takes place with the participation of 6,500 personnel from the armed forces and police.
The celebrations come amid one of the worst economic hardships in the country's history with imports for consumption and industries curtailed because of an acute foreign reserve shortage and high debt repayment obligations.
Rajapaksa in his speech called upon the people to have a positive attitude amid the crises.
The world has been changed and will be changed by those people with positive ideas, who dream of a future with optimism and strive to make it a reality. We see this throughout the history. Social progress in all developed nations has been possible due to the positive thoughts
of their leaders and the people, he said.
Difficult times do not last forever. People of great resolve are needed to face difficult times. Anyone who demoralizes another is not doing any good to the society at this moment. Therefore, all of us have an enormous responsibility to build a positive attitude in the country to face these crises successfully, Rajapaksa said.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) A commemorative march for cadets who died fighting against the invading Russian Red Army in 1918 took place in the Ukrainian capital Kyiv on Saturday.
On January 29, Ukraine honours 'Kruty Heroes' who died defending Kyiv, delaying the advance of the Red Army.
For many, honouring the bravery of fallen victims is especially important now, as fears rise that Russia is preparing to invade the Ukraine. 
The Kremlin denies it is planning an invasion. 
I understand that Ukraine is extremely important for me just as it was for them. This is what they fought for and gave their lives for this, said Anastasia Kovalskaya. 
Civilians and military members took part in the march and laid flowers at the graves of young soldiers. 
This is important because it was the first manifestation of the heroism of the Ukrainian patriotic forces in the fight against our primordial enemy - the Moscow invaders, said Kyiv resident Georgy Lukenchuk.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4364422

Some residents of Ukraine's second-largest city, Kharkiv, have been preparing to abandon their civilian lives and fight back if Russian forces invade.
The situation in Kharkiv, just 40 kilometers (25 miles) from the border where tens of thousands of Russian troops have massed, feels particularly perilous.
Last week, volunteers for Ukraine's Territorial Defense Forces were attending training sessions to get to grips with weapons and acquire basic defense skills.
The Ukrainian Army chaplain was on hand to give the group a heartfelt blessing. 
Kharkiv is a city of fractures: between Ukrainian speakers and those who stick with the Russian language that dominated until recently; and between those who enthusiastically volunteer to resist a Russian offensive and those who just want to live their lives.
Local pensioner Ivan Vasilyevich said he wanted to see unity between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine.
If there were unity between Russia, Belarus and Ukraine, that would be a strong united state that Europe could not defeat, he said.
There are growing calls in Washington for the United States to support a potential Ukrainian insurgency.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Crowds of people gathered in central Beijing Friday to watch fireworks being set off over the Bird's Nest stadium during the opening ceremony of the Winter Olympics. 
Many said they were filled with pride and filmed the fireworks with their phones.
I am very excited because it is a once-in-a-generation opportunity for Beijing to host the Winter Olympic Games, said Xu Pengfei, a car salesperson, who said he came early with his family to secure a good spot to see the fireworks. 
I think I'm lucky to be standing here, said Yan Qianhua, a sales executive. A lot of people who want to come probably wouldn't be able to see the corner of the Bird's Nest (Olympic stadium).
Security in Beijing has been stepped up before Friday's opening ceremony, with police blocking off streets surrounding the stadium and preventing the crowds from getting too close. 
I witnessed a streak of blue smoke, but that's good, that's ok, said Sun Runsheng, a Beijing resident. 
I don't ask for too much, he added.

      <description><![CDATA[(3 Feb 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4364412

President Joe Biden is sending about 2,000 U.S.-based troops to Poland and Germany and shifting 1,000 soldiers from Germany to Romania as demonstrations of American commitments to allies on NATO's eastern flank amid fears of a Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Pentagon said Wednesday.
Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said the soon-to-deploy U.S. forces are intended to temporarily bolster U.S. and allied defensive positions and will not enter Ukraine.
We're just ready to go and support whatever the nation needs us to do, U.S. Army Lt. Col. Brad Jordan says. 
The newly announced U.S. troop deployments are in line with expectations based on Biden administration efforts to reassure allies and demonstrate U.S. resolve without undermining efforts to find a diplomatic solution to the Ukraine crisis.
The U.S. already has several thousand troops in Poland, and Romania is host to a NATO missile defense system that Russia considers a threat to its security. Biden notably has not sent American military reinforcements to the three Baltic countries on NATO's eastern flank — Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania — that are former states of the Soviet Union.
Of the 2,000 deploying from Fort Bragg, North Carolina, about 1,700 are members of the 82nd Airborne Division infantry brigade, who will go to Poland. The other 300 are with the 18th Airborne Corps and will deploy to Germany as what the Pentagon called a joint task force-capable headquarters.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Germany expressed regret Friday that Russia has announced the suspension of mutual military inspections at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and NATO.
The inspections are intended as confidence-building measures among members of the Organizations for Security and Cooperation in Europe.
A spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said Russia recently announced it would suspend the inspections until the end of February, citing the spread of the omicron variant.
Because of this an inspection on Russian territory in the border region of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, which Latvia requested and Russia had previously agreed to, won't currently be possible, said the spokesman, Christofer Burger.
We expressly regret this step because particularly in the current situation anything which creates greater transparency would help reduce tensions, he said. That's why we are calling on Russia to voluntarily and extensively inform OSCE member states about its activities.
Burger said Russia had also unilaterally canceled inspections it was due to conduct in Germany.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) An important ecological reserve in Tierra del Fuego archipelago in southern Chile is under threat from forest fires which have already devastated more than 1,200 hectares close to the area.
The blaze, which started on 25 January, threatens the Karukinka Natural Park, an area of precious ecosystems and biodiversity.
The fire has reached Forestal Russfin forests bordering the park.
Emilia Undurraga, Chile's agriculture minister, travelled to the region to monitor firefighting efforts on Thursday. 
National Forest Corporation team members are coordinating the fire control operation. 
Felipe Valencia, incident fire commander, said the blaze was spreading faster than usual because of a particular type of oak tree found in the area. 
He said it produced the heaviest combustion that can exist, causing the flames to spread horizontally and vertically at the same time. 
Karukinka Nature Park is an ancestral territory of the native Selk'nam people in Patagonia, one of the world's best-preserved southernmost forests.

      <description><![CDATA[(3 Feb 2022) West African regional leaders refrained Thursday from imposing sanctions against the new military junta in Burkina Faso, instead requesting that the new rulers propose a firm date for returning the country to democratic rule.
The regional bloc known as ECOWAS had called the meeting to discuss Burkina Faso, but the spate of military power grabs and coup attempts throughout the region weighed heavily at the gathering in Ghana's capital. 
Three of the 15 countries in the bloc are currently suspended because of military coups: Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso. Earlier this week, security forces quelled a coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau too.
The regional bloc has announced economic sanctions against junta leaders and their families in Guinea and Mali.
It's added even more punishing economic penalties on Mali after elections were delayed by several more years.
But it didn't announce any economic sanctions yet against the military rulers in Burkina Faso.
Instead, ECOWAS reaffirmed its condemnation of the coup in Ouagadougou, and called for the immediate release of ousted President Roch Marc Christian Kabore. 
The bloc also announced it intends to send a stabilization force to Guinea-Bissau where gunmen tried to topple the president earlier this week. 
This is something that we will do very, very rapidly,” ECOWAS Commission President Jean-Claude Kassi Brou said.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) The U.K. Health Secretary on Friday joined other senior government ministers in defending remarks made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson where he claimed the leader of the opposition did not prosecute serial sex offender Jimmy Saville while he was Director of Public Prosecutions. 
Sajid Javid said on Friday that Labour party leader Sir Keir Starmer deserved respect for his role as head of prosecutions, and that Johnson had come out and clarified those remarks.
Johnson was rocked Thursday by the resignation of his policy chief, Munira Mirza, a trusted adviser who worked with him for more than a decade. 
Mirza stood by the prime minister amid “partygate” revelations that Johnson and his staff broke the rules they had imposed on the country. 
But she said Johnson’s “scurrilous accusation” this week that an opposition leader had failed to stop a notorious pedophile was the final straw.
Following her resignation, several other senior government officials have left their posts - chief of staff Dan Rosenfield, communications director Jack Doyle and principal private secretary Martin Reynolds. 
Elena Narozanski, who worked in Mirza’s policy unit, resigned Friday.
Conservative lawmakers loyal to Johnson have claimed the departures were of a planned overhaul to restore order to his 10 Downing Street office.
Javid on Friday saying the Prime Minister had his full support.

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday sought to play down fears of a war between his country and Russia, saying in a news conference that he did not believe that the situation is worse now than it was in early 2021 when Russia began amassing troops on the border between the two nations.
 President Joe Biden on Thursday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that there is a distinct possibility that Russia could take military action against the former Soviet state in February. Russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans.
Zelenskyy, however, sought to play down the war fears, said on Friday that Western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country's financial markets to cash out.
Meanwhile the head of a US Congressional delegation to Kyiv claimed on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had united his adversaries amid the threat of conflict in Ukraine.
He's united the EU, he's united the NATO members, he's united the Ukrainian people and he's united the United States Congress, said Gregory Meeks.
The representatives, headed by Meeks, are on a visit to Kyiv to meet with senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.
While there are no plans and no desires for American boots on the ground here, we must do all that we can short of that to help the Ukrainians, said Republican Mark Green.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) French President Emmanuel Macron held a video conference with Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan, Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and European Council President Charles Michel on Friday.
The leaders discussed the volatile situation at the border between two the ex-Soviet neighbours and regional tensions.
Armenia and Azerbaijan have been locked in a decades-old dispute over the separatist region of Nagorno-Karabakh, a region that lies within Azerbaijan but was under the control of ethnic Armenian forces backed by Armenia since a separatist war there ended in 1994.
Fierce fighting that erupted in September 2020 ended six weeks later with a Russia-brokered peace deal that saw Azerbaijan gain control of a significant part of Nagorno-Karabakh and reclaim all the regions that were controlled by Armenian forces outside the separatist region.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Novak Djokovic on Friday was flanked with honors at a small Adriatic Sea resort in Montenegro, as fresh doubt emerged over the timing of the positive COVID-19 test he used to enter Australia in an attempt to compete in the Australian Open.
The BBC reported on Friday that there are discrepancies in the numbers of his tests that were issued by the health authorities in Serbia with the numbers of other tests issued at the same time in the Balkan country.
Djokovic's media team and the Institute of Public Health in Serbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press. Senior Serbian health officials have previously said that his test was valid and issued by a relevant institution.
Djokovic was deported from Australia and barred from playing in the Australian Open earlier this month after a 11-day visa saga on the eve of the tournament because he failed to meet Australia's strict COVID-19 vaccination requirements.
To enter Australia, Djokovic submitted a positive COVID-19 test issued in Serbia from Dec. 16 for a visa exemption on the grounds that he had contracted the disease prior to the tournament.
The 34-year-old player is not vaccinated and the Australian government decided to cancel his visa and deport Djokovic, saying his presence in Australia could stir anti-vaccination sentiments.
Djokovic has said he would make no public comments until the end of the Australia Open.
On Friday, several hundred people greeted Djokovic outside the municipal building in Budva as he arrived there to receive a plaque declaring him an honorary citizen of the town.
Top Budva official Marko Carevic also presented Djokovic with an Orthodox Christian icon in gratitude for helping preserve the Serbian people and the Serbian church in Montenegro.
Djokovic is adored in his native Serbia and among the Serbs in neighboring Montenegro, a small nation of some 620,000 people. Since he returned home, Djokovic was seen visiting churches and attending liturgies in both Serbia and Montenegro.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Members of a Ukrainian paramilitary unit have begun training civilian volunteers in the capital city in case of a Russian invasion. 
The Georgian Legion, formed in large part by ethnic Georgian volunteers to fight against Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2014, now includes people of various nationalities. 
Those who have joined include people from countries such as the U.S. and Albania, recruited to help bring more foreign volunteers to the group.
Justin Dee from the U.S., who has previously served in the French Foreign Legion, says he is hoping to get more Americans involved to form the unit and be deployed to eastern Ukraine. 
Currently there are few U.S. citizens in the Georgian Legion, but according to its commander, by the end of February at least 30 more Americans could be joining. 
Emanuel Bazanji from Albania was a professional soldier for the Albanian military forces before joining the Georgian Legion three-and-a-half years ago. 
According to Bazanji, members of the legion are on rotation, some are deployed to the east and others are training civilians in Kyiv. 
The training of civilians takes place three days per week, for four hours.
The Commander of the Georgian Legion, Mamuka Mamulashvili, said they usually trained army or militia troops, but that this time they decided to help with training civilians. 
According to Mamulashvili, up to 3,000 volunteers will be trained at the Georgian Legion base in Kyiv.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) Hundreds of Kosovars on Saturday held a protest against the government's plans to increase the price of energy.
Protesters gathered in the capital Pristina and moved toward the parliament building, shouting anti-government slogans against the Prime Minister Albin Kurti.
Police scuffled with protesters as they tried to guard the entrance of the government building and demonstrators threw light bulbs that smashed against windows.
Dardan Molliqaj, organizer of the protest, told the crowd that, if the government do not change tack, we will be here every day, stronger, bigger and more courageous.
The government says it is unable to keep supplies at the current price.
Electricity in Kosovo costs 6 cents per kWh, the cheapest in Europe as household tariffs are heavily subsidized.
Kosovo produces all its energy with coal-fired and ailing power plants and has been obliged to import up to 40% of its energy.
Prices are now up to ten times higher compared to a year ago.

Despite relative calm in Ukraine's east, soldiers who have been defending against Russian encroachment are preparing for an escalation.
At the Novooleksandrivka outpost, the soldiers in the small garrison are wary as they keep watch over the landscape. 
Soldiers worry that a first strike could be in easter Ukraine, where pro-Russia separatists have been in control since 2014.
Soldier Vikor Beliekov wonders if an attack might come from the sea to the south.
Our navy is not enough to withstand heavy attack, he told the Associated Press, I think the coastline could be easily captured. Everyone thinks through Kharkiv or Donbass but it's a wrong point of view. If they decide to attack, they will do it from the sea.
Tensions have soared in recent weeks as Russia moved about 100,000 troops near the border with Ukraine.
NATO allies are bolstering their presence in the Baltics, and the U.S. has put 8,500 troops on alert.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) A third day of efforts to rescue a 5-year-old boy who fell into a well in northern Morocco were halted shortly on Friday following concerns about ground stability, fueling despair among those hoping to reach him.
The boy, identified as Rayan, has been trapped inside the well since Tuesday evening. He fell into the 32-meter (105-feet) deep well located outside his home in the northern village of Ighran in Morocco's Chefchaouen province.
Digging has stopped momentarily out of concern that the ground surrounding the well could collapse, rescue committee member Abdelhadi Temrani told local television 2M.  
Search crews used five bulldozers to dig vertically to a depth of more than 31 meters, according to Morocco's official MAP news agency.  
Preparations are underway to start digging horizontally to create a pathway to reach the trapped boy, MAP said, adding that experts in topographical engineering were called upon for help.  
Rescue workers used a rope to provide oxygen and water to the boy, but were unable to reach the hole where he is trapped due its narrow diameter.
Medical staff, including specialists in resuscitation, are on site to attend to the boy once he is pulled out, with a helicopter on standby to transport him to the nearest hospital.
The Moroccan government said Thursday that all efforts are being made to help save the boy.  
Moroccans took to social media to offer their hopes for the boy's survival, using the hashtag #SaveRayan which has brought global attention to the rescue efforts.  
I pray and beg God that he comes out of that well alive and safe, his mother Wassima Kharchich said.

      <description><![CDATA[(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:
Asia is at the gateway of a new lunar year and anticipation is high for the Year of the Tiger which begins on February 1st.
In the East the tiger isn't just a ferocious animal, it is seen as a powerful symbol of protection from bad things and those born in the Year of the Tiger are credited with being ambitious, courageous and generous.

STORY-LINE:
Here in Leofoo Village Theme Park in northern Taiwan, the tigers play.
Although the animals are revered here, there are no tigers living in the wild in this country.
This theme park has 12, some of them are white tigers and the rest are Bengal tigers.
According to the Chinese zodiac this year 2022 belongs to the tiger. 
Tigers in this zoo are kept in different enclosures, according to each animal's personality and physical conditions.
Zookeeper Randy Liu says the cats here are very mischievous.
When we clean their place, they take our brooms as cat teasers. When we are cleaning up, they play with our brooms. They (tigers) also urinate on us when they are behind us when we clean up. In winter, we would feel something warm on our back. Then, we know that we've been urinated on. The smell is quite strong, but we are used to it, and we say to ourselves 'here you go again…' Normal people would hardly accept such a thing, says Liu.
Since 2017, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has recognised two tiger subspecies.
These are commonly referred to as the continental tiger and the Sunda island tigers which can now only be found in Sumatra.
According to the IUCN the continental tigers include Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese and the Amur, which is commonly called the Siberian tiger.
Liu believes the role of the zoo is to ensure the survival of the species that still survive. 
He explains: One single tiger needs a very wide space to live. The biggest problems tigers encounter are the loss of habitat and species. The role of a zoo is to keep the species existing. We try to give tigers the best living quality under limited conditions. So, in terms of multiplication, we are not seeking unlimited breeding. We would choose the most rare gene specification, and our best conditions to keep tigers.
Here in Taiwan the tiger is deified and worshipped, it even has its own temple.
The Tiger Temple is located on a steep slope on a remote area in northern Taipei. But worshipers are still numerous.
Real estate manager Randy Lin comes here regularly and he attributes his good fortune to the Tiger God.
Next year is the Year of the Tiger. So, today, I am here at the Tiger Temple to pray to the Tiger God for a safe and peaceful year as well as a prosperous career before the New Year comes. I have been visiting this temple for a year now. The Tiger God has been good to me. My career path was also smooth, says Lin.
Chen Forng-shean, a Taiwanese artist sculptor who also doubles as a ceramist and calligrapher recently sculpted a miniature tiger in gold.
At only 2 millimetres by 3 millimetres it has to be seen through a magnifying glass and Chen claims it's the tiniest tiger a human has ever sculpted.
Chen says: Its (the sculpted gold tiger) head has eyes, nose and mouth. It has its mouth opened. The most difficult part is that its front right paw is raised. This is a 3-millimetre tiger. I had to make its limbs, head and tail. It was very difficult to make. You can appreciate this tiger from all directions. 
Chen believes the Year of the Tiger will be an auspicious year.
The Year of the Tiger starts on February 1, which marks the first day of the year on the lunar calendar.

With its opening ceremony now just a week away, China has been using the Beijing Winter Olympics to promote winter sports, many of which are new to most Chinese, for fitness and business opportunities. 
The push has proved lifechanging for Li Wei. 
The tall, tanned 36-year-old farmer-turned ski coach works December to March at a resort in the Yanqing district, which will host skiing, luge and other sliding events for the Beijing Games.
Skiing boosted my income to another level, said Li, who charges 400 to 500 yuan ($60 to $80) per lesson — almost as much as his family earns in a week growing corn during warmer months. 
Many in Beijing have long enjoyed winter ice skating on canals and lakes. But now, young Chinese are expanding their aspirations from basketball, football and gymnastics to sports such as hockey and skiing.
The government and private companies have built ice rinks and ski runs. 
Public schools are adding skating and other winter sports. Parents are opening their wallets to pay for hockey teams and skating lessons. Villages near ski slopes are building inns to serve well-heeled tourists.
Wu Mengkai, 11, said hockey has turned him to being more extroverted and a very sunny person.
You can't be introverted when you play ice hockey, Wu said. You have to be brave enough to fight.
The Chinese capital has tightened anti-virus measures and ordered mass testing of some 2 million people in one district following outbreaks. Some families are barred from leaving their homes.
The Winter Games will take place without foreign tourists or ordinary spectators under China's zero tolerance strategy that aims to keep the virus out of the country. Athletes, reporters and officials are required to stay within areas that isolate them from general public.
Foreign sports brands see growth opportunities in China but are frustrated that marketing and business development are hampered by the anti-virus controls and ban on most foreigners from entering China.
That's kind of put a damper on things, said Jeffrey Potter, president of Proskatecorner Pte. Ltd., the China distributor of American hockey equipment maker True. 
If not for the virus, the marketing boost from the Olympics would have been bigger, really helping the economy and making hockey more popular, Potter said.
Despite the Games being off limits to ordinary spectators because of the pandemic, enthusiasm for winter sports remain high.
I want to be an ice hockey player in the future, said eight-year-old Guo Yuchen, who took up the sport at four and trains seven hours a week at a rink in Beijing. Then I can bring glory to my country.

Marching bands and pop-up shrines contributed to the festive atmosphere at the parade, which took place in the central Thai city of Nakhon Sawan, some 250 kilometers (160 miles) north of Bangkok.
The event was part of week-long festivities being observed under tight COVID-19 restrictions.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) An oil slick off the coast of Thailand continued to expand Friday and was approaching beaches on the east coast, home to fragile coral and sea grass, officials said. 
The oil leak from an undersea hose at an offshore mooring point used to load tankers was stopped early Wednesday morning, but not before 140 to 375 barrels, or between about 22,000 and 60,000 liters (5,800 to 15,850 gallons), spilled into the Gulf of Thailand, according to Star Petroleum Refining, the operating company.
There are now two slicks, a small one about one square kilometer (less than half a square mile) that is closer to the coast and another that has broadened to 47 square kilometers (18 square miles) that is not far behind it, said Siam Lawawirojwong, director of the department that deals with disasters at Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency. 
The Royal Thai Navy, which has been part of the cleanup and containment effort, said the main slick is expected to reach an area of coast including the Khao Lam Ya National Park by about 10 p.m. 
The park is home to a variety of seabirds and fish.
In preparation, floating booms were being deployed to try and trap the oil and contain it so that it can be collected from the surface and removed. 
Pornsri Sutthanarak, deputy director-general of the Marine and Coastal Resources Department, said Thursday that if the oil reaches the coast, it might also affect 59 acres of coral and 118 acres of sea grass, causing environmental damage that would take time to rehabilitate.
Initial estimates from Thailand's Pollution Control Department were that much more oil had leaked than reported by Star Petroleum Refining, and Siam said it was not possible at this juncture to say exactly how much was in the slicks. 
Speaking on the beach in preparation for clean up efforts Governor of Rayong Charnna Iamsaeng said the company that is responsible for this mistake must take full responsibility.
The leak occurred at about 9 p.m. local time Tuesday at a mooring station about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate, south of Bangkok, Star Petroleum Refining said.
On Thursday the main slick covered 11.65 square kilometers (4.5 square miles) and Star Petroleum Refining said it had been spraying dispersants on the slick to try and clear it from the surface as it approaches Rayong province beaches. 
In all, four ships have been deployed to skim oil off of the sea's surface and another seven have been spraying the dispersants, the company said.

Ninety-two-year-old Lida remembers World War II, so houses ruined by artillery shelling is nothing new to her. 
She blames everything on the former Ukrainian president Petro Poroshenko.
An LPR (Luhansk People's Republic) militia fighter, who gave The Associated Press only his call sign (The Bear), talked about the cultural abyss between the two sides.

The opening ceremony for the Beijing Winter Olympics ended with a barrage of fireworks, marking the start of the Games under heavy virus restrictions.
  
The ceremony ended with the lighting of the torch on a large spinning snowflake, after which torchbearers brought the flame to a cauldron outside the National Stadium. 
With the dimming of the lights, Beijing became the first city to host both Winter and Summer Games.
The Olympics - and the opening ceremony - are always an exercise in performance for the host nation, a chance to showcase its culture, define its place in the world and flaunt its best side.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Iraq's Yazidi community, from which many women and children were kidnapped and enslaved by the Islamic State group in 2014, welcomed on Friday the news of the death of the IS leader during a U.S. raid in Syria.
Displaced Yazidis living in Sharia Camp, in Iraq's Dohuk governorate —  many of whom are women who suffered at the hands of IS —  expressed relief about the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.
The IS leader blew himself up along with members of his family as American forces raided his Syria hideout Thursday, the U.S. said.
Gawri Khedhir, a Yazidi woman from Sinjar, was taken along with her family by IS militants when they took over the district in August 2014. She was taken by the militants to the nearby Tel Afar town before managing to escape in 2016. 
Her husband, son and daughter are still missing since then. 
According to an Associated Press report published in May 2020, al-Qurayshi was a religious judge at the time and labeled one of the architects of the militant group's enslavement of Iraq's Yazidi religious minority.
He rose to become deputy to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. 
The operation of killing al-Qurayshi came as IS has been trying for a resurgence, with a series of attacks in the region, including an assault late last month to seize a prison in northeast Syria holding at least 3,000 IS detainees, it's boldest operation in years. 
Hana Shakir, a Yazidi survivor who was in IS captivity and returned in 2018, said she still has fears that the militants might make a comeback.
We want to achieve our rights. I mean the elimination of those who did this to us, she said, speaking from her tent in Sharia Camp.
IS tried to exterminate the Yazidis, a religious minority with beliefs that distinguish them from Muslim and Christian worshippers in the region.
IS destroyed villages and religious sites, lined men up and shot them before kidnapping thousands of women and children, trading them in modern-day chattel slavery.
The United Nations has called the IS assault on the Yazidis' ancestral homeland in northern Iraq in 2014 a genocide, saying the Yazidis' 400,000-strong community had all been displaced, captured or killed.

      <description><![CDATA[(4 Feb 2022) Hundreds of migrants gathered outside the Mexican immigration office in Tapachula, a border city with Guatemala, to protest against police raids on small hotels and other places of shelter where migrants have been staying.  
The city has become a way station for migrants from Central America, Haiti, Cuba and other places, because Mexico requires many people file for refugee or asylum status there.  
Raids have occurred before, but this week activists say agents swept up people from sidewalks outside migrant shelters. 
Many are forcibly returned to their home countries. 
Agents are prohibited from entering the shelters to detain people, but many migrants have camped out around the overcrowded facilities. 
Salvadoran migrant Mario Guzmán was detained by immigration agents a few weeks ago in Tapachula's central park, even though he had papers showing he made a claim for asylum. 
They told us those papers were no good, they were fake, and they ripped them up, said Guzmán, who was held for three weeks at an immigration detention center and given two weeks to leave Mexico. 
A group of about 30 migrants called for a hunger strike to demand that authorities speed up the issue of papers so that they can leave Tapachula.   
Irineu Mujica, an activist with People without Borders, said it is taking almost five months for migrants  to get their papers, so he joined the hunger strikers promising to be with the migrants for as long as my body can handle.
The immigration institute said Monday there has been a surge in detentions, with the number of migrants detained in Mexico up 78% in January from a year ago. 
It said 16,740 migrants, mainly from Central America, were detained in January, compared to 9,406 over the same month last year. 
It was unclear if the number of migrants was less last year because of last winter's coronavirus surge, or for some other reason.  
Children and young people under age 18 made up 14.5% of the migrants detained, and a total of 780 were found to be unaccompanied by family members, the agency said.

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) The city of New York has given an emotional final salute to a rookie police officer gunned down with his partner a week ago. 
A funeral Mass for Jason Rivera was held Friday morning at St. Patrick's Cathedral. 
Mayor Eric Adams, who is a retired police captain, says he sees an echo of himself in the slain officer who had joined a department he had seen as flawed in hopes of improving it. 
The 22-year-old Rivera was recently married and barely into his second year on the force. 
He and Officer Wilbert Mora were fatally wounded when a gunman ambushed them in an apartment as they responded to a family dispute.
During the funeral service, New York City Police Commissioner Keechant Sewell posthumously promoted Rivera to the rank of Detective First Grade.
