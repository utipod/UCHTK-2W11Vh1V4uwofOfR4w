    <description>(28 Jan 2022) Divers, veterinarians and the coast guard were mounting a rescue operation Friday to help a whale calf that had become trapped in shallow water in a seaside area of the Greek capital.&#13;
The animal was an injured young Cuvier’s beaked whale, or Ziphius cavirostris, according to Arion, a research organization that provides veterinary care for stranded cetaceans. &#13;
The species usually inhabits deep waters, and it was unclear how it had been injured and why it became stranded in the Alimos area of southern Athens. &#13;
On Thursday, the whale had been sighted in shallow water in the nearby area of Vouliagmeni, and divers had been called in to lead it out to sea. &#13;
The operation had initially appeared successful, but the animal returned to shallow waters Friday morning.&#13;
“The prognosis unfortunately isn’t good,” said Environment and Energy Deputy Minister Giorgos Amyras, who was at the scene. &#13;
“The fact that it has been in these shallow waters for so many hours doesn’t give us much hope. But we of course are doing everything possible to save the animal,” he added. &#13;
He said two specialized veterinarians, a specialized veterinary nurse and four aid organizations had been brought in to try to save the whale.&#13;
A blood sample had been drawn and sent for analysis to determine what medication the animal might need, while an antibiotic had already been administered, Amyras said.&#13;

      <description><![CDATA[(28 Jan 2022) Germany has a coronavirus wave powered by the omicron variant under control despite a string of new infection records, the health minister said Friday.
Cases as a result of the highly contagious variant in the European Union's most populous nation shot up at a later stage than in several other countries in the region. 
Officials attribute that to restrictions such as curbs on private gatherings, nightclub closures and requirements for restaurant and bar patrons to have received a booster shot or to present a negative test. 
Yet infections continue to rise steeply in the country of 83 million. 
On Thursday, new cases reported in the previous 24 hours topped 200,000 for the first time. 
On Friday, the infection rate reached another record of 1,073 new cases per 100,000 residents in a week.
Those numbers didn't deter Health Minister Karl Lauterbach from declaring that authorities “have the omicron wave in Germany well under control at the moment.”
Lauterbach told reporters in Berlin that the infection rate among the elderly - many of whom remain unvaccinated - is much lower than the average.
The omicron variant surge is so far slightly below projections, Lauterbach said. 
Daily infections are expected to reach up to 400,000 before falling, likely in mid-February. 
The drop could come later the same month because of a mutation of omicron known as BA.2, he added.
