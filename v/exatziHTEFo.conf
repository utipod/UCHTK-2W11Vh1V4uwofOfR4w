title = "Ancient city uses horse as bin collector"
description = "(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:\nOn the steep and narrow streets of an ancient city in Kosovo, bins are still collected by horse.\nWhere modern vehicles can't go, a bin collector and his horse continue to assure a public service.\n\nSTORY-LINE:\nFor the last four decades, the city of Prizren in Kosovo has had an unusual bin collecting duo: Nexhmedin Berisha, 66, and his horse. \nFive days a week, they go up and down the narrow cobbled streets of the old neighbourhood of Nenkala (Under castle), something which has turned them into local heroes.\nNo vehicles can climb the steep streets of this part of the city, located 85 kilometres (50 miles) southwest of the capital Pristina.\nPrizren, Kosovo's second most populous city, is on the banks of a river and features a fortress overlooking the city. \nThe site has been used since the Bronze Age according to archaeological excavations. \nBerisha collects bin bags from each house in Nenkala, a neighbourhood often nicknamed "quarter of the windows" since houses were built so close to each other.\n"With the pandemic there have been many difficulties for people but this man has always come to our houses to collect waste. He is a successful, glorious man for the residents of this neighbourhood. It is very difficult for him, with the slopes but he still goes to take the waste, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. There have been many people infected with the virus but he goes. We are very pleased," says Pash Moneka, a resident in Prizren's Nenkala quarter.\nLocal authorities are pleased with his work, which helps preserve the city's ancient site.\n"I've been doing this job for 44 years. Only the horse can pass through these streets. With my horse I collect the waste and have always continued to work, respecting the job," says Berisha, while holding his horse.\n"I have never stopped, regardless of the snow or the rain. I have never stopped working. Where the trucks can't go uphill I go with the horse. I have never had any obstacle from people. I am always ready, in death funerals or weddings, always trying to leave them (the people) satisfied. I have never had problems with them, now for 44 years."\nAnd that's the most important thing to Berisha: continuity.\n"The reason why we are using a horse in these streets is because the trucks cannot go to this old part of Prizren. The paths are very narrow and only the horse may pass through them and that protects old Prizren, traditions of the old Prizren. We have always applied this form of service. Even during the pandemic, we have not stopped. We have done such a service five days per week," says Flamur Nomlexhiu from the waste management company of Eko Region.\nCollecting the waste is not the only service which has turned Berisha into a local hero. \nHis horse almost never climbs back empty - it  brings food and other goods Berisha buys at the city for the retired people up in his quarter.\nBerisha is paid 210 Euros ($238) per month, just enough money to support himself.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/a89ffc21c238474b88adb2f96aeb91aa"
