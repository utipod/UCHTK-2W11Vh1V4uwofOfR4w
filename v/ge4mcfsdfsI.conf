description = "(4 Feb 2022) Forces of Yemen's internationally-recognized government have reclaimed large swathes of territory in a southern province from Iran-backed Houthi rebels, government officials said.\nThe Yemeni Armed Forces Media Centre stated on its official page on Twitter that the army forces, backed by the popular resistance, have liberated several sites from the Houthi militia control in the Mas front, northwest of Marib. \nThe push in the southern province of Shabwa comes amid heavy airstrikes by the Saudi-led coalition battling the Houthis elsewhere in Yemen, including the capital, Sanaa.\nThe rebels have also stepped up their cross-border attacks, using ballistic missiles and explosive-laden drones to target Saudi Arabia.\nYemen's civil war began in 2014 when the Houthis took Sanaa and much of the northern part of the country, forcing the government to flee to the south, then to Saudi Arabia.\nThe conflict has since become a regional proxy war that has killed tens of thousands of civilians and fighters.\nGovernment troops, aided by fighters from the Giants Brigades militia, swept through Shabwa earlier this month, retaking most of the Usaylan district from the Houthis.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/fbad1e2b2fbd4c48a7ab3c616bab8e95"
