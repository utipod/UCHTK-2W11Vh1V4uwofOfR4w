description = "(28 Jan 2022) The first group of Ukrainian soldiers took part in military exercises Friday using anti-tank missile systems received from the UK. \nThe training consisted of three days of theory and tactics practice followed by two days of practical exercises for the Next generation Light Anti-tank Weapon (NLAW).\nServicemen fired at targets at a distance of 300 to 600 metres from various positions.\nThe last stage of the drills took place in the International Centre for Peacekeeping and Security of the National Academy of Ukrainian Land Forces in the Lviv region. \nAbout 40 future NLAW instructors received certificates after the five-day course was over. \nThey will be dispersed to military divisions to train new specialists.\nAccording to the instructors, NLAWs can be operated by one person and their accuracy allows a user to hit the target in any weather. \nRussia's top diplomat said Friday that Moscow will not start a war in Ukraine but warned that it wouldn't allow the West to trample on its security interests, amid fears it is planning to invade its neighbor.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/edcd64a1d6fa485992dea0ac6e6a1272"
