title = "Reaction in Syrian village to US raid on IS"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) The landlord of Syrian house destroyed in U.S. raid that killed Islamic State leader Thursday said he was "shocked" by his tenant's identity.\nMusab al-Sheikh thought he had rented his house to a displaced car dealer from the northern province of Aleppo and had no idea that the leader of the Islamic State group was living in the three-storey house he owns in the northwestern Syrian town of Atmeh. \nThe man, who is believed to have been a top aide to IS leader, always paid on time during the time he stayed in the house paying $130 a month. \nThe man in his early 40s later said he wants to bring his sister to live on the top floor and she did.\nNo one knew that among the people who moved in was IS top leader, Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi, who was killed in a U.S. raid on the safehouse in Atmeh. \nPresident Joe Biden said al-Qurayshi had been responsible for major assault on a Syrian prison last month as well as genocide against the Yazidi people in Iraq in 2014.\nWhen helicopters carrying some 50 U.S. commandos thumped onto the ground in Syria an hour after midnight, the raiders confronted a houseful of extremists and children.\nBaby comforts were inside — a stuffed bunny, a blue plastic swing, a crib. So was the paraphernalia of violence - such as the bomb Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi is said by U.S. officials to have used to blow up himself, his family and perhaps others in his immediate proximity.\nIt was an audacious raid in an extremist stronghold of northwest Syria, months in the works and executed with the understanding that children might die as well as the hunted IS chief if the building's occupants did not get out when given the chance to leave.\nThe apparent suicide bombing came before or early in a two-hour gun battle Thursday. First responders said 13 people died, six of them children. No U.S. commandos were wounded, military officials said.\nOver months of planning, U.S. intelligence first had to locate al-Qurayshi's whereabouts and understand his movements - or lack thereof. \nThey concluded he rarely, if ever, left his family's third-floor quarters except to bathe on the building's roof. \nAnticipating that al-Qurayshi could well choose death by self-detonation if cornered by U.S. forces, U.S. officials commissioned an engineering study-from-afar of the three-storey, cinder-block building to see if it would collapse in that event and kill everyone inside.\nThey concluded that enough of the building was likely to survive such a blast to spare those not near him.\nThe Islamic State group, which once controlled most of the territory in Iraq and parts of Syria, has been attempting to regenerate, and staged its most ambitious operation in years when it seized a prison in northeast Syria last month holding at least 3,000 IS detainees.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/29fc03f6f7e448aebbfe82747ca80463"
