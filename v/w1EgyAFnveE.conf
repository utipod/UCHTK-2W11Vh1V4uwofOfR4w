description = "(28 Jan 2022) An oil slick off the coast of Thailand continued to expand Friday and was approaching beaches on the east coast, home to fragile coral and sea grass, officials said. \nThe oil leak from an undersea hose at an offshore mooring point used to load tankers was stopped early Wednesday morning, but not before 140 to 375 barrels, or between about 22,000 and 60,000 liters (5,800 to 15,850 gallons), spilled into the Gulf of Thailand, according to Star Petroleum Refining, the operating company.\nThere are now two slicks, a small one about one square kilometer (less than half a square mile) that is closer to the coast and another that has broadened to 47 square kilometers (18 square miles) that is not far behind it, said Siam Lawawirojwong, director of the department that deals with disasters at Thailand's Geo-Informatics and Space Technology Development Agency. \nThe Royal Thai Navy, which has been part of the cleanup and containment effort, said the main slick is expected to reach an area of coast including the Khao Lam Ya National Park by about 10 p.m. \nThe park is home to a variety of seabirds and fish.\nIn preparation, floating booms were being deployed to try and trap the oil and contain it so that it can be collected from the surface and removed. \nPornsri Sutthanarak, deputy director-general of the Marine and Coastal Resources Department, said Thursday that if the oil reaches the coast, it might also affect 59 acres of coral and 118 acres of sea grass, causing environmental damage that would take time to rehabilitate.\nInitial estimates from Thailand's Pollution Control Department were that much more oil had leaked than reported by Star Petroleum Refining, and Siam said it was not possible at this juncture to say exactly how much was in the slicks. \nSpeaking on the beach in preparation for clean up efforts Governor of Rayong Charnna Iamsaeng said "the company that is responsible for this mistake must take full responsibility."\nThe leak occurred at about 9 p.m. local time Tuesday at a mooring station about 20 kilometers (12 miles) southeast of the Map Ta Phut Industrial Estate, south of Bangkok, Star Petroleum Refining said.\nOn Thursday the main slick covered 11.65 square kilometers (4.5 square miles) and Star Petroleum Refining said it had been spraying dispersants on the slick to try and clear it from the surface as it approaches Rayong province beaches. \nIn all, four ships have been deployed to skim oil off of the sea's surface and another seven have been spraying the dispersants, the company said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/1c6401f69f0e42b0b0c49c35a3f4411e"
