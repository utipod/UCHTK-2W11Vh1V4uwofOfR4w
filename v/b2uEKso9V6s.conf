description = "(4 Feb 2022) Families played games and danced at a government-run sports-themed plaza in Beijing on Friday in anticipation of the opening of the 2022 Winter Olympics.\nEven if the Olympics are being held with strict COVID-19 prevention measures, with spectators being asked to clap instead of cheer, there was still a festive air in the capital city.\nAt the Winter Olympics Culture Plaza in Beijing, neighborhood dance troupes performed as families gathered to join in the excitement.\n"I hope that that our athletes do well, and together show the world our future," said Liu Jingyun, who was part of a group of dancers.\nHer team of dancers had already started preparing to welcome the Games four years ago by decorating the flat taiping drums they performed with snowflakes.\nAnother group swirled through the plaza on rollerblades, wearing matching red and white outfits and helmets.\n"Because Beijing is a dual-Olympic city, we are incomparably proud and excited that Beijing is hosting the Winter Olympics," said rollerblader Qiang Junxian.\nMuch of the event was staffed by volunteers like Zhang Xinrui, a college senior.\n"This Winter Olympics, it's like an international festival, and as a volunteer, it's a hugely important thing for me as a college student, and even in my life," Zhang said.\nThe Chinese government, in hosting the Winter Olympics, has actively promoted winter sports, and that has successfully spread to some of its population.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/4df192f886ef4042b0a4e65c67e2b248"
