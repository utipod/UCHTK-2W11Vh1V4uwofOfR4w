description = "(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN:\nForced to leave their homeland after the Taliban seized power, two young Afghan women have opened a restaurant in the Albanian coast city of Shengjin.\nBy serving Afghan dishes to the around 1,000 refugees now staying in the coastal town, the two women hope to provide a welcome taste of home.\n\nSTORY-LINE:\nVisiting a local supermarket in the Albanian coastal town of Shengjin, 22-year-old Walwala Jalalzay and 19-year-old Maryam Aslami are searching for ingredients.\nThe two young Afghan refugees have opened a restaurant called "Kabul-Shengjin". The idea is to bring the taste of home to the around 1,000 Afghan refugees now staying in the city.\nThey use the few Albanian words they've managed to learn during their three-month stay to order the goods they desire.\n"At first, when we were coming here, we were using some body language to describe what do we want," says Jalalzay.\n"Slowly, we are learning names, and we are learning things that we want, and we know the places that where is the location of something, where is the position of something that we can use."\nBack at the restaurant, to the sound of music from their motherland, they open the eatery every day. \nMaryam's two sisters also help make food and serve the customers. \n"When we came here, obviously, we missed our country, we missed our people, we missed the environment, we missed our parents back behind, but we cannot go back to our country, and maybe they cannot come in here. So, the only thing now that we can do is to bring the taste of the foods in here," says Jalalzay.\n"We decided to open the restaurant to bring the taste of home in here."\nThe restaurant has become an attraction for locals hoping to sample Afghan food.\n"We found the dishes very interesting. It is the first time we tried (Afghan food)," says local Sonila Islamaj.\nAlbania has sheltered thousands of Afghan evacuees in hotels or tourist resorts. \nThe Balkan country was one of the first to offer to host up to 4,000 Afghan refugees.\nBut Jalalzay doesn't intend to stay here. She's waiting on clearance to travel to the United States and join her brothers who are both living in Virginia.\nShe doesn't know how long she'll stay in Shengjin but knowing the situation in her home country - especially when it comes to women's rights - she feels blessed for have found her way to Albania.\nSince their return to power, the Taliban have imposed widespread restrictions, many of them directed at women.\nDisappointed with what's happening back in her home country, Jalalzay still hopes things will get better.\n"We hope they (Taliban) stand up on their promises that they have given," she says.\n"At the first, they said they will let girls and ladies to have their rights, to be educated, to go out. So, now we are seeing they are doing the opposite of what they say. So, I just hope the situation gets better soon."\nThe Taliban's sweep to power in Afghanistan in August drove billions of dollars in international assistance out of the country and sent an already dirt-poor nation, ravaged by war, drought and floods, spiraling toward a humanitarian catastrophe. \nIt's estimated that roughly 90 percent of Afghanistan's 38 million people are dependent on aid and the U.N. says nearly 3 million are displaced in their own country, driven from their homes by drought, war and famine.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/62fd9dbf3e3249c5873a7a02d0e95120"
