description = "(4 Feb 2022) Enthusiastic fans are flocking to collect merchandise and souvenirs from the Beijing Winter Olympics. \nIn a 20 square meter (215 sq ft) room deep in an alleyway in the Chinese capital, 35-year-old Zhang Wenquan keeps around 5,000 Olympic souvenirs - mascots, flags, torches and pins.\nHe's collected the assorted items from around the world - Beijing, Sochi, Munich, Pyeongchang - since the last Beijing Games in 2008. \nZhang said he's felt a special connection with the Olympics ever since he worked as a volunteer in 2008, delivering score cards.\nHe claims to have invested over 500,000 RMB (78,600 US dollars) in his hobby. \n"I check online about every hour and see if there is new Olympic souvenir released," said Zhang. "My life has been filled with the Olympics."\nThough eager to be part of the Winter Games scheduled to open Friday, Zhang couldn't be a volunteer or buy a ticket for the opening ceremony, due to strict coronavirus measures. \n"I have been trying so hard to watch it at the scene, but because of the epidemic, there may be no chance," he said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/32f6646ef71c43d6a9cb2c6400537a7d"
