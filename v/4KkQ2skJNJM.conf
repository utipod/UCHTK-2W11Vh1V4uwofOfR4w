description = "(28 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:   \nThe Iraqi army says it was reinforcing the country's border with Syria, building more fences and deploying additional troops to prevent the Islamic State militants from infiltrating the border.\nThe new measures come after IS militants launched a large operation last week at a prison in Syria's Hassakeh where the extremist group sought to break thousands of its fighters out of the detention facility.\n\nSTORY-LINE:  \nThe Iraqi army on Thursday said it was reinforcing the country's border with Syria after U.S.-backed Kurdish forces clashed in a weeklong battle with Islamic State militants at a prison in the nearby Syrian city of Hassakeh.\nIraqi Army commanders said they were building a third fence and deploying additional troops at the borderline to prevent IS militants from infiltrating the border area.\nThe new fence starts from Sinjar district in Nineveh province all the way down to Al Qaim in Anbar province.  \nMaj. Gen. Jabbar Naima Karam, the commander of West Nineveh Operations, said all observation towers are equipped with supporting weapons, night visions, and infrared cameras that are connected to operation rooms at the Border Force Command base in Mosul.  \n  \n"We reassure our people that our units are capable of protecting the border," he said.\nHassakeh, where IS launched a large operation to break thousands of its fighters out of the Gweiran prison in northeastern Syria, is about 50 km (30 miles) away from the Iraqi border.\nThe attack was the biggest by IS since the fall of the group's "caliphate" in 2019 and came as the militants staged a number of deadly attacks in Syria and Iraq that stoked fears they may be staging a comeback.  \n  \nChief of Staff of the Iraqi Army Lt. Gen. Abdul-Amir Rasheed Yar Allah assured the Iraqi people that the assault in the nearby Syrian city won't affect the border.\n"Our message to all of our people is that things are good on the Iraqi-Syrian borders. What is happening in Hassakeh did not have a big impact on our territories so far." \nThe Islamic State group's territorial control in Iraq and Syria was crushed by a years-long U.S.-backed campaign, but some fighters remained at large in sleeper cells that have killed scores of Iraqis and Syrians over the past months.  \nIraq shares a 599-kilometer (372-mile) border with Syria.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/32f2ba5e21b84c5ea2208889fad2d8a6"
