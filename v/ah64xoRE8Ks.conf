title = "Exiled artist Ai Weiwei reflects on Beijing Olympics"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) The dissident Chinese artist behind the giant lattice-style "Bird's Nest" venue in Beijing that was hosting Friday's opening ceremonies of the Winter Games had tough words for China's government and others that kowtow to it.\nAi Weiwei mocked what he called the Chinese government's excessive and ineffectual lockdown measures to fight COVID-19, and its poor human rights record – saying hopes that it might have improved since Beijing hosted the 2008 Summer Games have gone unfulfilled.\n"I think it's really, really unbelievable after 14 years of this -- this game, same game -- we turn to the same country, a country (that has) not developed an inch towards better human rights and the better freedom of speech conditions, but rather become very arrogant," he told the Associated Press in an interview by video conference.\nThe Chinese dissident widely regarded as one of the world’s greatest living artists has repeatedly described the 2008 Olympics as a “fake smile” that his native country presented to the world.\nAi Weiwei also took aim at the International Olympic Committee, saying the Winter Games means "big business for them." \nHe faulted the IOC, saying it "never protected" human rights and has shown itself to "always defend … whatever China is doing – and which is a pity."\nHe chuckled derisively when told about a tweet from World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who tweeted a photo of himself in a red-and-white "Beijing 2022" winter track suit and matching wool cap as he carried the Olympic flame during the torch relay in China.\nUnder Tedros, the U.N. health agency came in for severe criticism from then-U.S. President Donald Trump's administration in 2020 for its alleged missteps and excessive deference to and praise for China when the COVID-19 pandemic first appeared in the city of Wuhan and its surrounding some two years ago.\n"He should get a gold medal from China because he never asked the right question." Ai Weiwei quipped. \n"Where is his conscience, this guy? You know, all those people who are supposed to defend the human health and give the right information, but never ask the right question and always on the side of the propaganda," he said.\n"They're so ridiculous," Ai Weiwei  added.\nThe artist didn't give a pass to other countries either – both those like Russia, which were represented at the highest official levels, and some Western countries who boycotted the Games or decided to stay away for reasons like COVID-19 concerns, faulting them for a double-standard.\n"They very, like, softly say, 'we are not officially attending'. For me, that is like a joke," AI Weiwei said. \n"So the West -- the problem is, cannot find a better strategy -- but to use that as like a smoke gun to say, 'OK, we're defending those principles.'"\n"But in the reality, they are not: They are business as normal," he added.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7bb57e9292774a5387d641a83e3f9d30"
