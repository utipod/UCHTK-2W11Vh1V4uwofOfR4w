description = "(28 Jan 2022) Germany has a coronavirus wave powered by the omicron variant "under control" despite a string of new infection records, the health minister said Friday.\nCases as a result of the highly contagious variant in the European Union's most populous nation shot up at a later stage than in several other countries in the region. \nOfficials attribute that to restrictions such as curbs on private gatherings, nightclub closures and requirements for restaurant and bar patrons to have received a booster shot or to present a negative test. \nYet infections continue to rise steeply in the country of 83 million. \nOn Thursday, new cases reported in the previous 24 hours topped 200,000 for the first time. \nOn Friday, the infection rate reached another record of 1,073 new cases per 100,000 residents in a week.\nThose numbers didn't deter Health Minister Karl Lauterbach from declaring that authorities “have the omicron wave in Germany well under control at the moment.”\nLauterbach told reporters in Berlin that the infection rate among the elderly - many of whom remain unvaccinated - is much lower than the average.\nThe omicron variant surge is so far slightly below projections, Lauterbach said. \nDaily infections are expected to reach up to 400,000 before falling, likely in mid-February. \nThe drop could come later the same month because of a mutation of omicron known as BA.2, he added.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c691948eda1f4705a17994e7e2a3f72a"
