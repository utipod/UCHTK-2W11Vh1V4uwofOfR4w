description = "(28 Jan 2022) Thousands of people in the Democratic Republic of Congo have been displaced after they fled ongoing clashes between the Congolese army and M23 fighters this week. \nOn Tuesday, a fresh attack carried out by the "March 23 Movement", or M23 , targeted a Congolese army position in the territory of Rutshuru, just north of the city of Goma in eastern Congo. \nWhile authorities confirmed the attack, they did not provide any details about it. \nEyewitnesses told The Associated Press that they saw gun fights and dead bodies. \nSince the beginning of this week, inhabitants from six villages in the country's east – including, Bukima, Nyesisi, and Ruhanga – have fled the violence. \nAt least 2,000 people are now living in improvised shelters, in churches, schools or with host families. \nOn Friday, the AP interviewed several eyewitnesses who fled to Kibumba and found shelter in a local church. \nBaseme Mashukano was a resident of Nyesisi, one of the six villages caught in the cross fire.\n"The attack began in Nyesisi, Ngungo, Kanombe. When we were in the field on Wednesday, we heard bullets over the hills and we fled. We abandoned everything and now we are here in Kibumba. We spend the night in the church while others sleep outside, we have nothing to eat, no food, no water or medicine," said Baseme. \nAnother person displaced by the conflict, Sarah Kasigwa, says in the chaos she lost her three children and husband. \n"We saw several dead people" she said. "We are sleeping here, in this school, on the ground. There is just cement, no blanket, we suffer a lot." \n32-year-old Tumaini Anouarite, a mother of five, said that she saw soldiers firing bullets in the nearby hills, and gunfights between the army and M23 fighters. \nOn Friday, MONUSCO blue helmets were deployed in the area. \nThe M23, which also calls itself the "Revolutionary Army of Congo", is a former rebellion of Congolese backed by Rwanda and Uganda, which was defeated in 2013. \nSince November, the movement has been accused of being behind several attacks against the army. \nThe attack took place in the vicinity of Virunga National Park, a UNESCO heritage site, renowned for its large gorilla population.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9962e45292064dbc8ecfec33480fe129"
