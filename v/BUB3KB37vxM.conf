title = "Austria vaccine mandate ready to come into force"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) A law requiring most adults in Austria to get vaccinated against COVID-19 is ready to take effect, but the sense of urgency that accompanied its announcement in November has largely evaporated. \nFew other countries look likely to go as far, as attention instead turns to loosening restrictions.\nThe Austrian mandate for residents aged 18 and over to get vaccinated — the first of its kind in Europe — cleared its last legislative hurdle Thursday when parliament's upper house approved what Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein called "a forward-looking and active step." \nThe President signed the legislation Friday.\nIt's expected to become law in the coming days but it will be a while before Austrians notice any practical change. \nIt isn't clear when or even whether the toughest part of the plan, which was watered down from the initial proposal, will take effect. \nOnly in mid-March will police start checking people's vaccination status during traffic stops and checks on coronavirus restrictions. \nPeople who can't produce proof of vaccination will be asked in writing to do so, and will be fined up to 600 euros ($680) if they don't; fines could reach 3,600 ($4,120) euros if people contest their punishment and full proceedings are opened.\nIn a third phase, officials would check the national vaccination register and send reminders to people who still aren't vaccinated on dates set by the government, leading to potential fines.\nWhen and if those methodical checks start depends whether authorities, helped by a commission of experts that will report at least every three months, deem vaccination progress sufficient. \nThe Austrian mandate — which will exempt pregnant women, people who can't be vaccinated for medical reasons and those who have recently recovered from COVID-19 — was first conceived as cases caused by the delta variant surged amid concern that the country's vaccination rate was low for Western Europe. At present, 69% of the population is considered fully vaccinated.\nOfficials argue that, even with the now-dominant omicron variant causing milder illness and Austria preparing to ease some coronavirus restrictions, the mandate makes sense.\nThe Chief Doctor for the Samaritan Federation of Vienna told The Associated Press that while she believes the mandate may help give vaccination figures a boost, especially among "those who are concerned about the mRNA vaccines", those holding back due to steadfast beliefs wont be persuaded. \n"An absolute anti-vaxxer won't be persuaded by the vaccine mandate. Those people will pay the fines," Susanne Drapalik said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5ae6006517fb48e388e735895976016d"
