title = "Yemen rebel UAE attack brings tragedy to Indian families"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) First, there was a pop, like firecrackers, then the world itself seemed to splinter.\nRamjan Rath felt a sharp pain. He looked down, and realized he was on fire. \nRath, whose fuel tanker blew up in a deadly attack on Abu Dhabi last month claimed by Yemen's Houthi rebels, was standing by his truck filling out forms when the drones hit.\n"I saw my vehicle burning right in front of my eyes. … There was fire on my feet," he told The Associated Press on Wednesday from an Indian canteen in Mussafah, the industrial district of Abu Dhabi where the explosion occurred at a nearby state-owned oil facility, ADNOC. \n"It wasn't clear what had happened, it all happened so fast." \nHe remembers blood gushing from his leg as he ran for his life. Sirens howled. Hours later, he was in a hospital room.\nRath, 24, grew up in a tiny village in the northwestern Indian state of Rajasthan, the youngest son of a farmer.\nHe knew nothing of the war that has riven Yemen, killed thousands of civilians and spawned the world's worst humanitarian disaster.\nHe'd never heard of the Iran-backed Houthis who seized Yemen's capital, Sanaa, in 2014, and have been battling a Saudi-led coalition that includes the UAE.\nLike the millions of other low-paid expats who make up the vast foreign labor force powering the UAE's economy, he had come to the country four years ago for work — the chance to carve out a bit of security for his parents and four older sisters in rural India.\nIt was a relentless life as a truck driver, working up to 12 hours a day to send money home. But it was a safe one.\nUnlike in India, he said, the police were honest, the roads well-paved. He never feared for his life in the UAE - home to oil-rich Abu Dhabi and glitzy Dubai — long a refuge in a region mired in conflict and economic collapse. \nYet that changed in a single, violent instant.\n"There's pain, physical and mental. When I sleep at night, or whenever I'm alone, I remember the blast," Rath said.\nHe recalls being consumed by guilt in the hospital bed, thinking the inferno must have been his fault, the result of some safety mishap he'd overlooked.\nHis leg wound required 10 stitches. The ache lingers, causing him to limp. His truck is gone. He can't work until he heals. He will never tell his family what happened to him, he said. It's a burden they cannot bear.\nBut he is alive, and for that he said, he is grateful. Three of his colleagues from India and Pakistan were killed — years of work and accumulated opportunities put to an abrupt end.\nOne of those colleagues was Hardeep Singh. Newly married at 29, he had a bachelor's degree in computing, enviable skills in the ancient Indian sport of Kabbaddi, and dreams of joining his young wife in Canada.\n"Till now we are not accepting (that) this thing happened," said Hardeep's cousin Gagandeep Singh.\n"If you see Hardeep's face, there's always a smile on his face, always," Singh said, speaking from their village in the northern Indian state of Punjab. \nHardeep, known to his family as Appu, was the only child of a widow, saddled with the unyielding obligations of a breadwinner. After his wedding last spring, he returned to work in the UAE as a tanker driver for the Abu Dhabi National Oil Co.\nThe Saudi-led coalition has bombarded Yemen for years, drawing international criticism for hitting non-military targets like markets, schools, hospitals and wedding parties. \nThe attack on Abu Dhabi that wounded Rath and killed Hardeep triggered a fierce wave of Saudi and Emirati airstrikes on Yemen that killed civilians and took the entire country off the internet for days. \n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c402ce86e9a340dbb8ca8a079ab28997"
