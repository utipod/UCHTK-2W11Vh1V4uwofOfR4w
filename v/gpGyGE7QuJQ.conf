description = "(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:\nThe traditional Chinese New Year celebrations in London have been scaled down once again because of the pandemic, but smaller events will go ahead.\nThe London Eye will light up in red and gold to welcome in the Year of the Tiger and restaurants will be open. But organisers are asking people not to come en mass to China Town. \n\n STORY-LINE:\nNew lanterns for the Chinese New Year.\nLondon's Chinatown is getting ready for it biggest event, but this year, festivities are being scaled  down due to the pandemic.\nUsually, London's celebration of the Chinese New Year is the biggest outside of Asia. \n"Basically, as you know, every year we have a parade, we have lots of performances in Trafalgar Square, half a million visitors come to London (pre-pandemic) and we're having Charing Cross Road and also Chinatown is all pedestrians spaces. And then we have five stages performing all different cultural activities and lots of people come over and we celebrate Chinese New Year together. But unfortunately, this year we have to scale down so much," says Lawrence Lee, Spokesperson for the London Chinatown Chinese Association.\nFor now, the London Chinatown Chinese Association, which organises the event, is busy putting up new lanterns.\n"So we are luckily having sponsorship from the local businesses and also some banks. So a lot of lanterns, they will bear their names on it. And so it's just to symbolise their sponsorship and their charitable means. And also this year, it's been all designed and made in China. And then we shipped them over," says Lee.\nBut the event is being planned to cater to a more local audience spread across the two weeks of the Spring Festival. \nFor the organisers, it's a difficult balance to strike: attract visitors, but not too many.\n"We have to protect the general public. We don't stop to encourage people to come in masses, you know, to celebrate together, and they will be able to see our programmes on TV. And I do hope that people don't all rush into Chinatown because they can easily come and celebrate in the future. And because the Chinese New Year lasts for two weeks. So they can always come along and have some nice food and celebrate with us," says Lee. \nA market will be held from 5 p.m. until 10 p.m. in Chinatown on Monday (31 January). The London Eye will also light up in red and gold colours.\nLaura Citron, CEO of London and Partners says people still can to come to London to enjoy the Chinese restaurants and shops over the New Year celebrations.  \n"We're really excited about Chinese New Year in London this year. We won't be having the big festivities on Trafalgar Square that we've had in previous years for obvious reasons. But we're having a fantastic night market here in Chinatown behind me and our Chinese community is going to be celebrating and all of our favourite Chinese restaurants and shops will be open. So I think we're all really looking forward as Londoners to coming out celebrating Chinese New Year." \nMost people are expected to mark the occasion in a more intimate and private setting, most likely at home.\nIt's the case of Laiyuen Choi, a Londoner from China.\n"I'm going to have a dinner with my friends in a house. So we're probably going to have a hodgepodge, obviously. And we're going to play some games or something like that," says Choi.\nRestaurants and supermarkets are stocking up to face the peak of demand early next week, but not anywhere near the same quantities they used to order pre-pandemic.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9c75f914e77445f7a05109b6ddd834f1"
