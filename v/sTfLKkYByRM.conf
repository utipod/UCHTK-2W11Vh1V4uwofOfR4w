description = "(4 Feb 2022) Members of a Ukrainian paramilitary unit have begun training civilian volunteers in the capital city in case of a Russian invasion. \nThe Georgian Legion, formed in large part by ethnic Georgian volunteers to fight against Russian aggression in Ukraine in 2014, now includes people of various nationalities. \nThose who have joined include people from countries such as the U.S. and Albania, recruited to help bring more foreign volunteers to the group.\nJustin Dee from the U.S., who has previously served in the French Foreign Legion, says he is hoping to get more Americans involved to form the unit and be deployed to eastern Ukraine. \nCurrently there are few U.S. citizens in the Georgian Legion, but according to its commander, by the end of February at least 30 more Americans could be joining. \nEmanuel Bazanji from Albania was a professional soldier for the Albanian military forces before joining the Georgian Legion three-and-a-half years ago. \nAccording to Bazanji, members of the legion are on rotation, some are deployed to the east and others are training civilians in Kyiv. \nThe training of civilians takes place three days per week, for four hours.\nThe Commander of the Georgian Legion, Mamuka Mamulashvili, said they usually trained army or militia troops, but that this time they decided to help with training civilians. \nAccording to Mamulashvili, up to 3,000 volunteers will be trained at the Georgian Legion base in Kyiv.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b8fa19594c3747b3ab758b637ef0f757"
