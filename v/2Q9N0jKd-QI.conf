description = "(4 Feb 2022) The resort island of Bali is reopening to foreign travelers from all countries, with direct international flights resuming for the first time in two years.\nBut mandatory quarantine remains in place for all visitors.\nIn October, Bali had said it would begin welcoming foreign arrivals from 19 countries that meet World Health Organization criteria, such as having COVID-19 cases under control.\nBut there were no direct international flights to Bali until Thursday, when Garuda Indonesia, the state-owned airline, operated its first international flight in two years from Tokyo to Bali.\nSingapore Airlines will introduce a regular direct route to and from Denpasar in Bali starting Feb. 16, said an official at Bali's international airport.\nFully vaccinated travelers still need to quarantine for five days.\nTravelers with just one dose of COVID-19 vaccine must quarantine for seven days.\nIn 2019, Bali's airport accommodated more than 200 international flights with at least one million passengers per day.\nThe island was closed to international flights after COVID-19 hit Indonesia - the world's fourth most populous country - in 2020.\nTourism is the main source of income in Bali, which is home to more than 4 million people.\nIndonesia has reported more than 4.4 million total COVID-19 cases, including 27,197 new infections and 38 deaths on Thursday in the latest 24-hour period.\nHealth Minister Budi Gunadi Sadikin has said Indonesia's latest wave, which is driven by the highly contagious omicron variant, will likely peak at the end of February or in early March.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ba1bb6d32c2d4095b581f5c1472b657f"
