description = "(28 Jan 2022) The head of a US Congressional delegation to Kyiv claimed on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had "united" his adversaries amid the threat of conflict in Ukraine.\n"He's united the EU, he's united the NATO members, he's united the Ukrainian people and he's united the United States Congress," said Gregory Meeks.\nThe representatives, headed by Meeks, are on a visit to Kyiv to meet with senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n"While there are no plans and no desires for American boots on the ground here, we must do all that we can short of that to help the Ukrainians," said Republican Mark Green.\nDemocrat Tom Malinowski added that "the sanctions that we have prepared will be absolutely devastating" and "they will be imposed should he (Vladimir Putin) move, and he knows it."\nRussia said Friday it will not start a war in Ukraine but warned that the US and NATO have ignored its demands and left little room for compromise in the crisis.\nPutin told French President Emmanuel Macron the West has failed to consider Russia’s key conditions of halting further NATO expansion, stopping the deployment of alliance weapons near Russian borders, and rolling back its forces from Eastern Europe, the Kremlin said.\nThe US and NATO formally rejected those demands this week, although Washington outlined areas where discussions are possible, offering hope that there could be a way to avoid war amid the buildup of more than 100,000 Russian troops near Ukraine.\nRussia has repeatedly denied having any plans to invade its neighbor.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/05614d14fdd249c88bebdd7d9ec923f5"
