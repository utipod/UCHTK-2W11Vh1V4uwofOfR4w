We have not put out a list. The president made it very clear he has not made a selection and there are, if anyone is saying they plan to characterize whoever he nominates after thorough consideration with both parties as 'radical' before they knew literally anything about who she is, they just obliterated their own credibility," Psaki said.\nHer comments came after Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said he hoped Biden would not “outsource this important decision to the radical left.” \n"Our intention is to not play games. The president's intention is to consult with members of both parties, and his intention is to nominate a qualified candidate who after after completing a rigorous process, who is worthy of the excellence and decency of Breyer's legacy," Psaki added.\nThe press secretary also dismissed those who suggest Biden's pledge to name black woman to the Supreme Court is an example of affirmative action.\n"It's been over 230 years, as we know, since the Supreme Court came into being. A black woman has never served on it. And the president's view is that anyone who's saying that that's not possible or we can't find the most eminently qualified person, that's ludicrous," Psaki said. \n"The fact that no black woman has been nominated shows a deficiency of the past election processes, not a lack of qualified candidates to be nominated to the Supreme Court," she added.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/89812a1b739d4998afe6b3bd50c3af54"
