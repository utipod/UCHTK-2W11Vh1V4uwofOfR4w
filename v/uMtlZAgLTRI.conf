title = "GOP censures Cheney, Kinzinger"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) The Republican National Committee censured two GOP lawmakers on Friday for participating on the committee investigating the violent Jan. 6 insurrection and assailed the panel for leading a “persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political discourse.”\nGOP officials took a voice vote to approve censuring Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger at the party's winter meeting in Salt Lake City. The censure was approved a day after an RNC subcommittee watered down a resolution that had recommended expelling the pair from the party.\nThe censure accuses Cheney and Kinzinger of “participating in a Democrat-led persecution of ordinary citizens engaged in legitimate political activity."\nCheney, of Wyoming, and Kinzinger, of Illinois, are the only two Republicans on the House committee investigating the attack on the Capitol. Trump and other GOP members were incensed when Kinzinger and Cheney agreed to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s invitation to join the Democratic-led House committee, giving the Jan. 6 panel a veneer of bipartisan credibility.\nThe most consequential element of the censure is a call for the party to no longer support Cheney and Kinzinger as Republicans.\nThe censure - combined with support from RNC members from Wyoming - allows the party to invoke a rule to back candidates other than Cheney. It sets in motion a way for the party to support Cheney's primary opponent, Harriet Hageman, who has been endorsed by Trump. Wyoming's primary is in August. Cheney spokesman Jeremy Adler said in a statement that the move subverted the will of Wyoming voters.\nKinzinger, who will not seek reelection at the end of the year, addressed his new plans publicly for the first time in an interview with The Associated Press on Tuesday, almost exactly one year after launching his "Country First" political organization designed to purge Trump from the GOP. Yet Trump allies control the Republican Party apparatus at the state and national levels — in addition to party fundraising — leaving critics like Kinzinger few tools to work with.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ed154beef86e43fb92f2d57c2af5a114"
