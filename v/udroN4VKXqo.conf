description = "(29 Jan 2022) LEAD IN:\nAsia is at the gateway of a new lunar year and anticipation is high for the Year of the Tiger which begins on February 1st.\nIn the East the tiger isn't just a ferocious animal, it is seen as a powerful symbol of protection from bad things and those born in the Year of the Tiger are credited with being ambitious, courageous and generous.\n\nSTORY-LINE:\nHere in Leofoo Village Theme Park in northern Taiwan, the tigers play.\nAlthough the animals are revered here, there are no tigers living in the wild in this country.\nThis theme park has 12, some of them are white tigers and the rest are Bengal tigers.\nAccording to the Chinese zodiac this year 2022 belongs to the tiger. \nTigers in this zoo are kept in different enclosures, according to each animal's personality and physical conditions.\nZookeeper Randy Liu says the cats here are very mischievous.\n"When we clean their place, they take our brooms as cat teasers. When we are cleaning up, they play with our brooms. They (tigers) also urinate on us when they are behind us when we clean up. In winter, we would feel something warm on our back. Then, we know that we've been urinated on. The smell is quite strong, but we are used to it, and we say to ourselves 'here you go again…' Normal people would hardly accept such a thing," says Liu.\nSince 2017, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has recognised two tiger subspecies.\nThese are commonly referred to as the continental tiger and the Sunda island tigers which can now only be found in Sumatra.\nAccording to the IUCN the continental tigers include Bengal, Malayan, Indochinese and the Amur, which is commonly called the Siberian tiger.\nLiu believes the role of the zoo is to ensure the survival of the species that still survive. \nHe explains: "One single tiger needs a very wide space to live. The biggest problems tigers encounter are the loss of habitat and species. The role of a zoo is to keep the species existing. We try to give tigers the best living quality under limited conditions. So, in terms of multiplication, we are not seeking unlimited breeding. We would choose the most rare gene specification, and our best conditions to keep tigers."\nHere in Taiwan the tiger is deified and worshipped, it even has its own temple.\nThe Tiger Temple is located on a steep slope on a remote area in northern Taipei. But worshipers are still numerous.\nReal estate manager Randy Lin comes here regularly and he attributes his good fortune to the Tiger God.\n"Next year is the Year of the Tiger. So, today, I am here at the Tiger Temple to pray to the Tiger God for a safe and peaceful year as well as a prosperous career before the New Year comes. I have been visiting this temple for a year now. The Tiger God has been good to me. My career path was also smooth," says Lin.\nChen Forng-shean, a Taiwanese artist sculptor who also doubles as a ceramist and calligrapher recently sculpted a miniature tiger in gold.\nAt only 2 millimetres by 3 millimetres it has to be seen through a magnifying glass and Chen claims it's the tiniest tiger a human has ever sculpted.\nChen says: "Its (the sculpted gold tiger) head has eyes, nose and mouth. It has its mouth opened. The most difficult part is that its front right paw is raised. This is a 3-millimetre tiger. I had to make its limbs, head and tail. It was very difficult to make. You can appreciate this tiger from all directions." \nChen believes the Year of the Tiger will be an auspicious year.\nThe Year of the Tiger starts on February 1, which marks the first day of the year on the lunar calendar.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/fbf0b9abe46440d7ad94d50f2449dae3"
