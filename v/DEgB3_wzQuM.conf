description = "(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN:\nThe head of the Taliban religious police in one of Afghanistan's provinces says that his units will not disrespect people. But as the force sets up checkpoints on main roads, some Afghans worry that they could return to the harsh tactics of previous years.\n\nSTORY-LINE:\nSince the Taliban overran Kabul in August last year and seized control of the country, Afghans and the world have been watching to see whether they will reimpose their brutal rule of late 1990s.\nThe Taliban say that this time around their tactics are different. They say their religious police will only go out to talk to people.\nIn Herat, the capital of the province by the same name, Taliban policemen have been setting up checkpoints. In some cases, they are advising people to comply with Islamic law.\nThe director of the "Promotion of Virtue and Prevention of Vice" department in Herat maintains that his forces will not force people to change their lifestyles.\n"We have not ordered or allowed anyone to search people's phones or check their hairstyles, or disrespect anyone," says Sheikh Aziz-u-Rahman.\nThe agency is tasked with ensuring people observe the Islamic codes. Saudi Arabia has a similar body.\nIt is also part of a ministry with the same name, set up by Taliban in the building that once housed the Women's Affairs Ministry.\nDuring the Taliban's previous rule, the ministry was known for implementing a very harsh interpretation of Islamic law.\nTaliban police used to patrol in vehicles and punish any individual who was caught committing what they considered a crime. \nMen were not allowed cut their beards and any type of music playing was banned.\nThe Taliban also denied girls and women an education and barred them from public life. They required women to wear a full veil covering the body and face.\nWhile Taliban insist they will respect women's rights this time, Afghan women still face many restrictions. The Taliban have barred them from working outside the home in some areas.\nWomen's rights activist Fatima Farahi, who lived under the rule of Taliban from 1996 to 1999, still remembers the fear and anxiety people used to experience.\nShe's worried that more people will leave Afghanistan if more restrictions are imposed on them.\nThe country is already facing an economic collapse, and many businesses are closed.\nHairdresser Mohammad Naser is one of many barbershop owners worried about losing their businesses.\n"If extreme rules are implemented and people are not allowed to cut their beards or style their hair, we will suffer a great loss," Naser says, adding that he had already lost some clients.\nThe Taliban are facing major economic and security problems as they attempt to govern, and a growing challenge by Islamic State militants is further stretching their resources.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f5a31ccc6dce40d38bfe6d141118e866"
