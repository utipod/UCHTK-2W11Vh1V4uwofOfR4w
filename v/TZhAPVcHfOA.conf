description = "(4 Feb 2022) Ukrainian soldiers being trained by the U.S. military on Friday were taught how to use a weapon designed to destroy hardened bunkers - one of the munitions sent by the U.S. government to aid Kyiv amid increasing concern over Russian aggression against Ukraine. \nThe training, which was open for jounalists to film, took place on the outskirts of Ukraine's western city Lviv. \nSpeaking to journalists, Ukrainian millitary training chief Colonel Andriy Bestyuk praised the munition, saying it is capable of destroying structures where enemy might hide. \n"This weapon will also stop armored objects - hit them, and if the battle is in an urbanized area, it will allow you to shoot down a structure behind which the enemy will hide," he said. \nThere are growing calls in Washington for the United States to support a potential Ukrainian insurgency.\nWhile Russia’s forces are larger and more powerful than Ukraine’s, an insurgency supported by U.S.-funded arms and training could deter a full-scale invasion.\nRussia denies having plans for an offensive, but it demands promises from NATO to keep Ukraine out of the alliance, halt the deployment of NATO weapons near Russian borders and to roll back NATO forces from Eastern Europe. \nNATO and the U.S. call those demands impossible.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b8ff641788794770a15b87452c676f79"
