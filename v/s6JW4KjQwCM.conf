description = "(28 Jan 2022) Novak Djokovic on Friday was flanked with honors at a small Adriatic Sea resort in Montenegro, as fresh doubt emerged over the timing of the positive COVID-19 test he used to enter Australia in an attempt to compete in the Australian Open.\nThe BBC reported on Friday that there are discrepancies in the numbers of his tests that were issued by the health authorities in Serbia with the numbers of other tests issued at the same time in the Balkan country.\nDjokovic's media team and the Institute of Public Health in Serbia did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Associated Press. Senior Serbian health officials have previously said that his test was valid and issued by a relevant institution.\nDjokovic was deported from Australia and barred from playing in the Australian Open earlier this month after a 11-day visa saga on the eve of the tournament because he failed to meet Australia's strict COVID-19 vaccination requirements.\nTo enter Australia, Djokovic submitted a positive COVID-19 test issued in Serbia from Dec. 16 for a visa exemption on the grounds that he had contracted the disease prior to the tournament.\nThe 34-year-old player is not vaccinated and the Australian government decided to cancel his visa and deport Djokovic, saying his presence in Australia could stir anti-vaccination sentiments.\nDjokovic has said he would make no public comments until the end of the Australia Open.\nOn Friday, several hundred people greeted Djokovic outside the municipal building in Budva as he arrived there to receive a plaque declaring him an honorary citizen of the town.\nTop Budva official Marko Carevic also presented Djokovic with an Orthodox Christian icon in gratitude for helping "preserve the Serbian people and the Serbian church in Montenegro."\nDjokovic is adored in his native Serbia and among the Serbs in neighboring Montenegro, a small nation of some 620,000 people. Since he returned home, Djokovic was seen visiting churches and attending liturgies in both Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3882c5eb13394276a92d659d2b020a45"
