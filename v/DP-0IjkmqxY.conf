description = "(4 Feb 2022) Former Sandinista rebel commander Dora María Téllez, one of dozens of political detainees rounded up last year by Nicaragua's government, was convicted after a trial lasting only a few hours, a lawyers group said Thursday.\nTéllez, 65, led an assault on the National Palace in 1978 during the Somoza family dictatorship, holding congress members hostage in exchange for the release of rebel prisoners.\nFollowing Anastasio Somoza's overthrow the next year, Téllez served as health minister in the first Sandinista government, which was led by Daniel Ortega from 1979 to 1990.\nShe later split with Ortega and became a leader of the opposition Sandinista Renovation Movement.\nThe former leader of that movement, Ana Margarita Vijil, was found guilty of the same charge in a similar trial Wednesday.\nAna Lucía Álvarez, Vijil's niece, said they are not facing judges or prosecutors at the service of the citizenry here, but "but political operators of the dictatorship."\nÁlvarez' sister Támara Dávila is also in prison and awaiting trial.\nActivists Yader Parajón and Jaser Vado were found guilty on Tuesday and sentenced to 12 years each.\nParajón's older brother Jimmy was killed in a protest during the 2018 social uprising.\nAlso convicted Thursday was former student protest leader Lesther Alemán.\nAlemán became known in 2018 for challenging Ortega during a national dialogue convened during the social uprising.\nThe Judicial Defense Unit, a coalition of lawyers, said trials were held in the infamous Chipote prison, where 39 of the political opponents of President Daniel Ortega have been held for months.\nSeven others are under a form of house arrest. \nThe ruling Sandinista Front and its allies control Nicaragua's congress and all government institutions.\nAfter leading the revolutionary government, Ortega served as president from 1985 to 1990, before being re-elected to power in 2007.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b83fe9a69f504942bc50f459b4a53881"
