description = "(28 Jan 2022) President Joe Biden's commitment to nominating the U.S. Supreme Court's first Black female justice is an important step in addressing issues of gender, race and civil rights, legal experts say. \nJudith Browne Dianis, Executive Director of the Advancement Project, a racial justice organization, says that it is important to have a someone who has the lived experience of being a Black woman interpret constitutional law and make decision on the nation's highest court. \n"Having a Back woman on the Supreme Court is exciting, the idea of it, because finally, we will not only have someone who will bring the experience of being Black in America, but someone who has lived at the intersections of race and gender. And hopefully will be a person who understands how race and gender have played in the law," she said. \nShe said that while some have already criticized Biden's decision to appoint a Black female justice, she responds saying what is actually racist is that a Black woman has not sat on the Supreme Court since its inception. \nShe also said that the current nomination is "an opportunity for the legal profession to have more discussions about the term 'qualified.'"\nDianis said the qualifications that have been used in the past are "based on a career pathway that has been reserved for white men traditionally and some white women." T\nThere are "very few people of color and Black people who have that pathway because there is a lot of discrimination that happens along the way," she said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e44fbacc3a454edfb68abeeb2a44be76"
