description = "(28 Jan 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4363515\n\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy on Friday sought to play down fears of a war between his country and Russia, saying in a news conference that he did not believe that "the situation is worse now than it was" in early 2021 when Russia began amassing troops on the border between the two nations.\n President Joe Biden on Thursday warned Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy that there is a "distinct possibility" that Russia could take military action against the former Soviet state in February. Russia has repeatedly denied having any such plans.\nZelenskyy, however, sought to play down the war fears, said on Friday that Western alarm over an imminent invasion has prompted many investors in the country's financial markets to cash out.\nMeanwhile the head of a US Congressional delegation to Kyiv claimed on Friday that Russian President Vladimir Putin had "united" his adversaries amid the threat of conflict in Ukraine.\n"He's united the EU, he's united the NATO members, he's united the Ukrainian people and he's united the United States Congress," said Gregory Meeks.\nThe representatives, headed by Meeks, are on a visit to Kyiv to meet with senior Ukrainian officials, including President Volodymyr Zelenskyy.\n"While there are no plans and no desires for American boots on the ground here, we must do all that we can short of that to help the Ukrainians," said Republican Mark Green.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/4c5aaef7ed174d2db7897e38742ae10a"
