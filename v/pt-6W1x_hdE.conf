description = "(3 Feb 2022) West African regional leaders refrained Thursday from imposing sanctions against the new military junta in Burkina Faso, instead requesting that the new rulers propose a firm date for returning the country to democratic rule.\nThe regional bloc known as ECOWAS had called the meeting to discuss Burkina Faso, but the spate of military power grabs and coup attempts throughout the region weighed heavily at the gathering in Ghana's capital. \nThree of the 15 countries in the bloc are currently suspended because of military coups: Mali, Guinea and Burkina Faso. Earlier this week, security forces quelled a coup attempt in Guinea-Bissau too.\nThe regional bloc has announced economic sanctions against junta leaders and their families in Guinea and Mali.\nIt's added even more punishing economic penalties on Mali after elections were delayed by several more years.\nBut it didn't announce any economic sanctions yet against the military rulers in Burkina Faso.\nInstead, ECOWAS reaffirmed its condemnation of the coup in Ouagadougou, and called for the immediate release of ousted President Roch Marc Christian Kabore. \nThe bloc also announced it intends to send a stabilization force to Guinea-Bissau where gunmen tried to topple the president earlier this week. \n"This is something that we will do very, very rapidly,” ECOWAS Commission President Jean-Claude Kassi Brou said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b5a7bf0cc3db4ee2baba6f55032a3e24"
