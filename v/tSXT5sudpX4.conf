description = "(4 Feb 2022) A third day of efforts to rescue a 5-year-old boy who fell into a well in northern Morocco were halted shortly on Friday following concerns about ground stability, fueling despair among those hoping to reach him.\nThe boy, identified as Rayan, has been trapped inside the well since Tuesday evening. He fell into the 32-meter (105-feet) deep well located outside his home in the northern village of Ighran in Morocco's Chefchaouen province.\n"Digging has stopped momentarily out of concern that the ground surrounding the well could collapse," rescue committee member Abdelhadi Temrani told local television 2M.  \nSearch crews used five bulldozers to dig vertically to a depth of more than 31 meters, according to Morocco's official MAP news agency.  \nPreparations are underway to start digging horizontally to create a pathway to reach the trapped boy, MAP said, adding that experts in topographical engineering were called upon for help.  \nRescue workers used a rope to provide oxygen and water to the boy, but were unable to reach the hole where he is trapped due its narrow diameter.\nMedical staff, including specialists in resuscitation, are on site to attend to the boy once he is pulled out, with a helicopter on standby to transport him to the nearest hospital.\nThe Moroccan government said Thursday that all efforts are being made to help save the boy.  \nMoroccans took to social media to offer their hopes for the boy's survival, using the hashtag #SaveRayan which has brought global attention to the rescue efforts.  \n"I pray and beg God that he comes out of that well alive and safe," his mother Wassima Kharchich said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/45fe708b8c694f6d9653c8d782e4a2f3"
