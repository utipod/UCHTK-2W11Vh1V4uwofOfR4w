description = "(4 Feb 2022) An important ecological reserve in Tierra del Fuego archipelago in southern Chile is under threat from forest fires which have already devastated more than 1,200 hectares close to the area.\nThe blaze, which started on 25 January, threatens the Karukinka Natural Park, an area of precious ecosystems and biodiversity.\nThe fire has reached "Forestal Russfin" forests bordering the park.\nEmilia Undurraga, Chile's agriculture minister, travelled to the region to monitor firefighting efforts on Thursday. \nNational Forest Corporation team members are coordinating the fire control operation. \nFelipe Valencia, incident fire commander, said the blaze was spreading faster than usual because of a particular type of oak tree found in the area. \nHe said it produced "the heaviest combustion that can exist", causing the flames to spread horizontally and vertically at the same time. \nKarukinka Nature Park is an ancestral territory of the native Selk'nam people in Patagonia, one of the world's best-preserved southernmost forests.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f34b45bcbe574b76a787ab1b82e0f46d"
