description = "(29 Jan 2022) PIERRE CARDIN COLLECTION PAYS TRIBUTE TO LATE DESIGNER WITH SPACE AGE CONCEPT\nIt was fitting that Friday (28 JANUARY 2022) evening's homage to Pierre Cardin—a fashion show in his honor—took place at the Le Bourget Air and Space Museum, north of Paris. The iconic French designer is famous for his space age fashions going back to the 1960s. He passed away in December 2020, at age 98, but he was still designing up until the end.\nThe collection, "Cosmocorps 3022," was shown outside, at the foot of an Ariane 5 European space launch vehicle. It was also livestreamed to audiences in Tirana, Moscow, Dallas, and Mexico, many of them young students in the fashion industry.\nThe show started with archival footage of the late designer and his creations on two giant screens. This was followed by 30 of the last looks designed by Cardin, realized in the Paris atelier. There were the bold pop colors, the mid-thigh trapeze dresses in stretchy fabrics, the unisex jumpsuits worthy of Star Trek, as well as exaggerated shoulders, cutouts and circular details, skinny futuristic sunglasses, and shiny black ankle boots. \nPart two represented the house's future, under the reins of Cardin's nephew, Rodrigo Basilicati-Cardin, the current CEO and artistic director. Working with three other designers from the studio, he created a collection for women and men that was still recognizably Cardin: two-tone jersey dresses in daring shades, such as red with magenta; stiff geometric shoulders and collars, colorful long capes for men. One dress featured a pair of brilliant pink hoops, like hula hoops. Others featured stiff disc-like shapes around the hips or torso. Metallic long evening gowns reflected the light. At the end, a woman dressed in white came out and danced like a whirling dervish, her skirt flaring as she moved.\nAfter the show, Basilicati-Cardin said the company has had the most loyal staff, which contributed to its success and continuity.\n"In the house I have people who have been working for 60 years…they lived all their life with us. Which is something special, it is not normal. I have to maintain that."\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/fa83ddfcb3b34f26b901a449a762e6cc"
