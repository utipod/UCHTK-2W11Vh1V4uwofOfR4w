description = "(29 Jan 2022) At least six people were gunned down on Friday night in the Honduran capital Tegucigalpa, in what would be the first major killing since President Xiomara Castro took power.\nThe attack took place at around 8 p.m. local time, when unknown individuals, heavily armed and dressed in military uniforms, began shooting in sector two of the Villanueva neighborhood.\nAt least six people died at the scene: five men in the street and one woman inside a house. \nPolice officers reported that the criminals fled the area after the attack, but minutes later, they were intercepted by officers who engaged them in a gun battle.\nPolice captured two men dressed as soldiers of the Armed Forces, who are presumed to be members of gangs operating in Tegucigalpa.  \nThe killings add to the national death toll of victims of the high level of insecurity in the Central American nation.\nHigh unemployment, persistent violence, corruption as well as troubled health care and educational systems are just some of the pressing challenges awaiting Castro, who was sworn in on Thursday.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/877adbec7801497484f4216cccb7187e"
