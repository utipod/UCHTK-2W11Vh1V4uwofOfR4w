description = "(4 Feb 2022) LEAD IN: \nA new fashion house in Gaza teaches aspiring Palestinian designers in the hope they will develop their own businesses.\n\nSTORY-LINE:\nA dozen Palestinian young men and women listen carefully as an instructor showed sketches of different dresses, shirts, and pants.\nThe students are members of a group attending a course at a new fashion house in the Gaza Strip.\nAya Eid and her husband Khalil Khudair opened the institution four months ago and are touting it as the first fashion design school in the impoverished Palestinian enclave.\nThe main motive behind Aya & Khalil Fashion House was a way for the couple to make a living. But they also hope to help others in Gaza, where unemployment is around 50% and is greater among youth. \n"The goal is to help improve the economic situation in Gaza and providing as many work opportunities as possible for our students in factories after they graduate," said Khdair.\nGaza has been under an Israeli-Egyptian blockade since the militant Hamas group seized power by force in 2007. \nHamas and Israel fought four devastating wars since then, most recently in May. \nThe fashion house opened in an apartment building in a downtown neighborhood which Israeli aircraft intensively targeted during the 11-day war.\nDozens have completed the fashion courses. \nSome have opened small enterprises at their houses and others are dreaming of having their own clothing label.\nThere are some college programs for fashion design in Gaza, but the tuition fees are out of reach for many young Gazans. \nAya and Khalil's classes are a more attainable option for students like Safeia Al-Mashharawi, who is looking to supplement her family's income .\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e9e81e53703848908fabce0a9b925360"
