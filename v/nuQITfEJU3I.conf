description = "(4 Feb 2022) The latest major winter storm to hit New England is generating some of the best conditions of the season for on the slopes of Stowe Mountain Resort in Vermont.\nThe resort reported Friday morning that 10 inches of snow had fallen overnight, and it was continuing to come down.\nJared Marshall is a resident of Denmark, Maine, and a member of the ski team of New Hampshire's Colby Sawyer College.\nHe was in Stowe for a ski meet and got to take the day off to enjoy the snow.\n"Ski season so far in the East Coast has been not too ideal with snowfall amounts have been a little low. But I think this recent storm really restores everyone's hopes on having a great season. The woods are great. The trails are great. I don't know the exact numbers that Stowe has right now, but they are mostly open and it's perfect no matter what type of skier or rider you are," Marshall said.\nMark Sloben drove eight hours from Wernersville, Pennsylvania, for a long weekend of skiing planned months ago.\nHe said the winter storm just made skiing conditions perfect.\n"I'm from Pennsylvania, little west of Redding, Pennsylvania. Came up here with my son, as a he gave it to me as a birthday present for a long weekend. The snow is fantastic, and the skiing is great, so far. We've only done one run, but it's been fantastic," Sloben said.\nThe winter storm swept into the ski slopes after wreaking havoc in other parts of the country.\nIt has already cut electric power to about 350,000 homes and businesses from Texas to the Ohio Valley is now causing misery in the Northeast. \nThe storm disrupted flights at major hubs in the U.S. on Friday, and ice threatened to wreak havoc on road travel and electric service before the storm heads out to sea late Friday and Saturday. \nThe storm began Tuesday and moved across the country during the week, causing a deadly tornado in Alabama and dumping more than a foot of snow in parts of the Midwest. \nIn Oklahoma, a 12-year-old boy was killed by a vehicle while sledding.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/540a63e519e1426a87f3145241f158f8"
