description = "(4 Feb 2022) In a surprising burst of hiring, America's employers added 467,000 jobs in January in a sign of the economy's resilience even in the face of a wave of omicron infections last month.\nThe government's report Friday also drastically revised up its estimate of job gains for November and December by a combined 709,000. It also said the unemployment rate ticked up from 3.9% to a still-low 4%, mainly because more people began looking for work and not all of them found jobs right away.\nThe strong hiring growth for January, which defied expectations for only a slight gain, demonstrates the eagerness of many employers to hire even as the pandemic raged. Businesses appear to have seen the omicron wave as having, at most, a temporary impact on the economy and remain confident about longer-term growth.\n"Retail did show a big gain in jobs, which I think the way the government does the numbers, it suggests that a lot of retailers didn't cut their holiday workers, which usually happens in January," says Associated Press reporter Chris Rugaber.\nAt the same time, the magnitude of the job growth points to an economy in which high levels of hiring and spending, combined with supply shortages, are accelerating inflation, wiping out pay raises and intensifying pressure on households. Those factors will likely give the Federal Reserve leeway to raise interest rates, perhaps even faster than it had planned, to cool inflation. The Fed has already indicated that it will begin raising rates in March, and it could do so again at its next meeting in May.\nStock futures dipped immediately on the expectation that the Fed could speed up its efforts to tighten credit, which would potentially weaken the economy, before partly recovering by mid-morning.\nA greater proportion of Americans are also now working or looking for work, the report showed, a trend that makes it easier for companies to find workers. It may suggest that concerns about long-term labor shortages have been overblown, at least in some industries.\nThe overall outlook for the job market remains bright, with openings near a record high, the pace of layoffs down and the unemployment rate having already reached a healthy level. \nThe White House COVID-19 Reponse Team says they're also prioritizing keeping frontline workers safe while returning to jobs. \n"We need to make sure they have tests so that if they do have symptoms, they're not going back into workspaces or places and spreading the virus or having their kids into school, potentially spreading the virus," Dr. Cameron Webb says.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bdc815ecdc6142509b4d3f0a74ff17d6"
