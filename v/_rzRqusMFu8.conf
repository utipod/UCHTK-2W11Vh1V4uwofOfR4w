description = "(4 Feb 2022) GUNS N' ROSES FRONTMAN AXL ROSE TURNS 60\nAxl Rose, the bandana-wearing singer of rock band Guns N' Roses, turns 60-years-old on Sunday (6 FEBRUARY 2022).\nBorn in Lafayette, Indiana on 6 February 1962, Rose shook up the pop and dance-dominated music scene of the 1980s along with bandmates Slash and Izzy Stradlin on guitars, plus bassist Duff McKagan and Steven Adler on drums.\nOver the years, the band built a reputation as one of rock's most exciting but controversial acts.\nThe official Guns N' Roses debut "Appetite for Destruction" was released in 1987, and included hits "Welcome to the Jungle," "Paradise City" and "Sweet Child O' Mine." The album spent five non-consecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200. The group went on to release EP "G N' R Lies" and the double album "Use Your Illusion I" and "Use Your Illusion II" - earning three Grammy nominations.\nBut there was also dysfunction within the band, and criticism of some lyrics as racist and homophobic.\nSlash and McKagan created an uproar in 1990 when they accepted honors at the American Music Awards with obscenity-laced speeches. Rose was accused of sparking a riot in 1991, when lunged at a fan with a video camera during a concert, and then stopped the show.\nThe band members went their separate ways in 1993 - an acrimonious split followed by a well documented feud, with Slash and Rose not speaking for many years.\nAfter the breakup, Rose fronted a new line up of the group, releasing the album "Chinese Democracy" in 2008. In 2016, he stepped in to sing for AC/DC on stage, when Brian Johnson was given medical advice to stop touring.\nThe same year, Rose reunited with Slash and McKagan for the first time in 23 years, to begin their hit  "Not In This Lifetime Tour."\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f690cc770d524f99b0956992df8de9b5"
