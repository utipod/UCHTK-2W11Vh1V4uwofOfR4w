description = "(4 Feb 2022) Queen Elizabeth II was interrupted by a canine gate-crasher as she viewed mementoes from her reign ahead of the 70th anniversary of her ascension to the throne. \nWhile the monarch inspected the memorabilia, including cards and artwork sent in by children and other members of the public to congratulate her on earlier anniversaries, one of her dogs trotted into the room at Windsor Castle. \nCandy - a cross between a dachshund and a corgi, known as a dorgi - lapped the room and inspected a small group of reporters on hand. \n“And where did you come from? I know what you want,” the queen chirped as Candy came over.\nThe event was held two weeks ago but announced by the palace on Friday ahead of the milestone on Sunday.\nElizabeth has three dogs. The elderly Candy, a young corgi called Muick, and a corgi puppy which replaced another puppy that died unexpectedly last year.\nCandy made an appearance at another event earlier this year, taking a star turn when Elizabeth held a face-to-face audience with the outgoing armed forces chief, Gen. Nick Carter, in November.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/856a32318d894c9bb87c208bfde02322"
