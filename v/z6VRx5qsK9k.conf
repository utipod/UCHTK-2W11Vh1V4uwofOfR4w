title = "Mexico steps up migrant raids near border"
description = "(4 Feb 2022) Hundreds of migrants gathered outside the Mexican immigration office in Tapachula, a border city with Guatemala, to protest against police raids on small hotels and other places of shelter where migrants have been staying.  \nThe city has become a way station for migrants from Central America, Haiti, Cuba and other places, because Mexico requires many people file for refugee or asylum status there.  \nRaids have occurred before, but this week activists say agents swept up people from sidewalks outside migrant shelters. \nMany are forcibly returned to their home countries. \nAgents are prohibited from entering the shelters to detain people, but many migrants have camped out around the overcrowded facilities. \nSalvadoran migrant Mario Guzmán was detained by immigration agents a few weeks ago in Tapachula's central park, even though he had papers showing he made a claim for asylum. \n"They told us those papers were no good, they were fake, and they ripped them up," said Guzmán, who was held for three weeks at an immigration detention center and given two weeks to leave Mexico. \nA group of about 30 migrants called for a hunger strike to demand that authorities speed up the issue of papers so that they can leave Tapachula.   \nIrineu Mujica, an activist with People without Borders, said it is taking almost five months for migrants  to get their papers, so he joined the hunger strikers promising to be with the migrants "for as long as my body can handle".\nThe immigration institute said Monday there has been a surge in detentions, with the number of migrants detained in Mexico up 78% in January from a year ago. \nIt said 16,740 migrants, mainly from Central America, were detained in January, compared to 9,406 over the same month last year. \nIt was unclear if the number of migrants was less last year because of last winter's coronavirus surge, or for some other reason.  \nChildren and young people under age 18 made up 14.5% of the migrants detained, and a total of 780 were found to be unaccompanied by family members, the agency said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/a20cf191c9dc4cc186b77bebde42dcea"
