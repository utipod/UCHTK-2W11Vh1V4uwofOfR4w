title = "Funeral in Hue of Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh"
description = "(29 Jan 2022) A funeral was held Saturday for the Vietnamese Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh, a week after the renowned Zen master died at the age of 95 in Hue in central Vietnam.\nThousands of monks and disciples trailed a procession of pallbearers carrying Nhat Hanh's coffin from Tu Hieu Pagoda, where he spent his last days, to the cremation site. \nOthers kneeled and clasped their hands in prayer on the roadside and bowed to the ground as the casket went past.\nNhat Hanh was globally recognized for helping spread the practice of mindfulness in the West and socially engaged Buddhism in the East.\nBorn Nguyen Dinh Lang in 1926 in Hue and ordained at the age of 16, Nhat Hanh distilled Buddhist teachings on compassion and suffering into easily grasped guidance over a lifetime dedicated to working for peace.\nHe founded the Plum Village Tradition, a practice of the art of mindful living, and gained a significant number of followers worldwide.\nDuring the seven-day wake, Nhat Hanh was laid in state in Tu Hieu Pagoda's full moon reception hall, where his disciples came to pay respect in silence and practice meditation as a tribute to his teachings.\n"I am happy and feel at peace that I could come to Hue to say farewell and meditate with 'Su Ong' for the last time," said Do Minh Hieu, a follower of Nhat Hanh's who traveled from Ho Chi Minh City with his family for the funeral. \nSu Ong is an affectionate Vietnamese term meaning "Grandpa Monk."\n"Su Ong has passed away but he's not gone. He stays with us in every walk, every breath, in our meditation," said another follower, Xuan Dung. \n"He lives in flowers, in leaves, in the clouds and in our mindful practices."\nAccording to his wishes, Nhat Hanh will be cremated and his ashes will be scattered at Plum Village centers and monasteries around the world.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ea7e131f49754e2dbca4a7338cd0247a"
