description = "(4 Feb 2022) Sri Lanka celebrated its 74th Independence Day from the UK with a state ceremony presided over by President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.\nThis year's Independence Day ceremony is being held in keeping with the health guidelines due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic situation. The event takes place with the participation of 6,500 personnel from the armed forces and police.\nThe celebrations come amid one of the worst economic hardships in the country's history with imports for consumption and industries curtailed because of an acute foreign reserve shortage and high debt repayment obligations.\nRajapaksa in his speech called upon the people to have a positive attitude amid the crises.\n"The world has been changed and will be changed by those people with positive ideas, who dream of a future with optimism and strive to make it a reality. We see this throughout the history. Social progress in all developed nations has been possible due to the positive thoughts\nof their leaders and the people," he said.\nDifficult times do not last forever. People of great resolve are needed to face difficult times. Anyone who demoralizes another is not doing any good to the society at this moment. Therefore, all of us have an enormous responsibility to build a positive attitude in the country to face these crises successfully," Rajapaksa said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6a25fdb25b2745fa9c652c4d43212d55"
