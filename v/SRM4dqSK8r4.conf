description = "(28 Jan 2022) When Markicia Horton, 25, graduates this spring from the Texas Southern University's Thurgood Marshall School of Law in Houston and takes the bar, she'll be stepping into a world where a Black woman is set to be on the U.S. Supreme Court for the first time in its 232-year history.\nWith Stephen Breyer's retirement from the court and President Joe Biden's commitment to name a Black woman as his nominee, it is likely that as Horton moves into a profession, there will be a Black woman as a Supreme Court justice. What that means for her and thousands of other young women of color in law schools or serving as lawyers around the country is incalculable. \nBut it comes as well, with concerns. According to the National Association for Law Placement, Black women made up 3.17 percent of associates at America's law firms in 2021 but less than 1 percent of partners. Women of color overall made up nearly 16 percent of associates at America's law firms but only about 4 percent of the partners.\n"I think that seeing the abortion cases presented before the Supreme Court and having another woman there essentially and having an African-American woman who can speak for the culture essentially as well as Americans as a whole, but just to give a different opinion," Horton says.\nThat, Horton said, is what a Black woman on the Supreme Court will bring to the table.\nHer point of view at the Houston school is one shared more than 1,100 miles away at the North Carolina Central University School of Law where Professor Brenda Reddix-Smalls raised the issue during a Zoom session of the constitutional law course she teaches.\nIn North Carolina, examples of prominent Black female jurists include current state Supreme Court Justice Anita Earls, who has been suggested as someone Biden could consider for the vacancy created by Breyer, and former state Supreme Court Chief Justice Cheri Beasley, who is favored to win the Democratic nomination in the state's U.S. Senate race. Beasley was the first Black woman to oversee North Carolina's judicial branch. \nAfter the class ended, several students lingered to ask questions about assignments, and talk turned back to Biden's upcoming pick. Adaora Oguno, a 28-year old second-year student from Nashville, Tennessee, said that Biden's pick will fill a century's old vacancy that has left issues specific to Black women unaddressed.  \n"This is our moment," says Chazle' N. Woodley, student body president at North Carolina Central University School of Law. "I'm excited, especially for the women who have been putting in the work."\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/11731419bd2b472e860d50446b004831"
