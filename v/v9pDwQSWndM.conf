description = "(28 Jan 2022) FOR CLEAN VERSION SEE STORY NUMBER: 4363392\n\nWith its opening ceremony now just a week away, China has been using the Beijing Winter Olympics to promote winter sports, many of which are new to most Chinese, for fitness and business opportunities. \nThe push has proved lifechanging for Li Wei. \nThe tall, tanned 36-year-old farmer-turned ski coach works December to March at a resort in the Yanqing district, which will host skiing, luge and other sliding events for the Beijing Games.\nSkiing "boosted my income to another level," said Li, who charges 400 to 500 yuan ($60 to $80) per lesson — almost as much as his family earns in a week growing corn during warmer months. \nMany in Beijing have long enjoyed winter ice skating on canals and lakes. But now, young Chinese are expanding their aspirations from basketball, football and gymnastics to sports such as hockey and skiing.\nThe government and private companies have built ice rinks and ski runs. \nPublic schools are adding skating and other winter sports. Parents are opening their wallets to pay for hockey teams and skating lessons. Villages near ski slopes are building inns to serve well-heeled tourists.\nWu Mengkai, 11, said hockey has turned him to being more extroverted and a "very sunny person."\n"You can't be introverted when you play ice hockey," Wu said. "You have to be brave enough to fight."\nThe Chinese capital has tightened anti-virus measures and ordered mass testing of some 2 million people in one district following outbreaks. Some families are barred from leaving their homes.\nThe Winter Games will take place without foreign tourists or ordinary spectators under China's "zero tolerance" strategy that aims to keep the virus out of the country. Athletes, reporters and officials are required to stay within areas that isolate them from general public.\nForeign sports brands see growth opportunities in China but are frustrated that marketing and business development are hampered by the anti-virus controls and ban on most foreigners from entering China.\n"That's kind of put a damper on things," said Jeffrey Potter, president of Proskatecorner Pte. Ltd., the China distributor of American hockey equipment maker True. \nIf not for the virus, the marketing boost from the Olympics would have been bigger, really helping the economy and making hockey more popular, Potter said.\nDespite the Games being off limits to ordinary spectators because of the pandemic, enthusiasm for winter sports remain high.\n"I want to be an ice hockey player in the future," said eight-year-old Guo Yuchen, who took up the sport at four and trains seven hours a week at a rink in Beijing. "Then I can bring glory to my country."\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/738ae9fb6d344cea8f0416b37957c75f"
