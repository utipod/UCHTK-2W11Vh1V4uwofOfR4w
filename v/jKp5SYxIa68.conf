description = "(4 Feb 2022) Turmoil in Peru's government boiled over this week as President Pedro Castillo overhauled his Cabinet for a third time in six months and then it quickly emerged his new prime minister has faced domestic violence claims, highlighting doubts about the political neophyte's ability to lead a nation.\nA group of women joined a rally outside the Women's Emergency Center in Lima on Friday to show their opposition to the appointments, in particular new Prime Minister Héctor Valer.\nShortly after the announcement, it became public that authorities in 2017 granted a protection order to Valer’s wife, who alleged domestic violence, and that a year earlier his daughter reported him to police for allegedly hitting her. \nValer denied the accusations Thursday during an interview with a radio station.   \nProtesters also criticised Castillo's new Minister for Women Katy Ugarte, who has previously suggested her opposition to education policies with a perspective on gender.\nCastillo on Tuesday appointed a new prime minister and replaced half of the 18-member Cabinet, including the ministers of finance and foreign relations. \nThe changes came after the previous interior minister and prime minister resigned and accused Castillo of not acting swiftly against corruption, an endemic problem in Peru. \nThey also complained that the 52-year-old leader listens to dubious advisers.  \nEvery Peruvian president of the past 36 years has been ensnarled in corruption allegations, with some imprisoned. One killed himself before police could arrest him.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e2a5c0ce8edc4f13bccb827b8177539e"
