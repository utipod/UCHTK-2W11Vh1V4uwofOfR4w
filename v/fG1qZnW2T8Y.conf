title = "Snow in Lebanon as cold front intensifies"
description = "(28 Jan 2022) The town of Chebaa is used to snow in January but a recent storm, which has blanketed most of Lebanon, has left the town with snowfall the town hasn't been seen in a decade.\nSnow trucks struggle to keep up with the amount of snow, leading many mountainous roads in Lebanon closed due to the weather.  \n"The roads are opening but that's not helping because the weather as you can see, a storm one right after the other. So the roads are staying closed so it has been hard to move around," said Mohammad Daher, a Chebaa resident.  \nA winter storm has been battering the eastern Mediterranean, bringing heavy rains and wind to the Middle East this past week. \nTemperatures reached below 0 Celsius in some parts of the Middle East.\nLebanon, a country of 6 million people, is home to 1.5 million Syrian refugees and as Lebanon grapples with an unprecedented economic crisis, poverty has deepened the Lebanese people. \nSky-rocketing fuel prices coupled with a currency collapse has meant many essential commodities, including fuel needed for heaters, are now out of reach for the average citizen.\nFor Dalal Moussa, the cold weather has isolated her in her home. \n"A person can't even go outside to go get some fruits even. We can even check on each other. Nothing. There is no diesel. If someone has a little bit of diesel, he's using it lightly so that we can last the winter," she said. \nShe turns off her heater at night to save on diesel and only stays warm in the coldest hours of the day with just blankets. \nAnd with no electricity, an electric heater is not a choice for many in Lebanon.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/230d0917e101491bbdced80a4c78dc13"
