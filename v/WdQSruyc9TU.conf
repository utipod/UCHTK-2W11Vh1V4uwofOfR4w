description = "(4 Feb 2022) Hundreds of Tibetan exiles marched near the Chinese Embassy in New Delhi on Friday denouncing the Beijing Winter Olympics and demanding freedom for their region.\nThey waved Tibetan flags and held placards bearing messages like "No Rights, No Games" and "Say No To Genocide Games." \nThey demanded that China leave Tibet and implored the international community to stand up against Beijing.\nThe protesters burned the Chinese flag. \nSome were detained by police after they jumped over security barricades and tried to run toward the Chinese Embassy.\nA large number of Tibetans have been living in exile in India since spiritual leader the Dalai Lama fled Tibet after a failed uprising in 1959. \nChina doesn't recognize the self-declared Tibetan government-in-exile in India and accuses the Dalai Lama of seeking to separate Tibet from China.\nHuman rights groups have dubbed the Beijing Winter Olympics the "genocide games," and the U.S. and other countries have cited rights abuses in leading a diplomatic boycott of the event.\nChina denies any human rights abuses, calling them the "lie of the century."\nMeanwhile, India won't be sending its top diplomat in Beijing to the Winter Olympics after the honor of carrying the Olympic torch went to a Chinese soldier who was wounded in a deadly border clash between the countries two years ago.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bc6f35e65bb6497eaeb97b0a32b49dda"
