description = "(28 Jan 2022) Hundreds of hard-line worshippers in Tehran demonstrated after Friday prayers in support of the Iranian-backed Houthis and to condemn the killing of Yemenis by the Saudi-led coalition.\nProtesters carried Yemeni flags and chanted slogans against Saudi Arabia and the United States as its ally. \nThey called Saudis "Wahhabi hypocrites" who they said killed Shiites and children in Yemen. \nDemonstrators marched on the streets near Tehran's great Musalla Prayer Ground, while some members of the Houthi rebels distributed pictures of Yemeni victims. \nThe protest came after the escalation of an offensive by the Saudi-led coalition on Houthi rebels, who are referred to as Ansarallah Movement by Tehran. \nA Saudi-led coalition airstrike hit a prison run by Yemen's Houthi rebels last Friday, killing at least 70 detainees and wounding dozens, a rebel minister said.  \nThe strike was part of a pounding aerial offensive that knocked the Arab world's poorest country off the internet. \nThe intense campaign came after the Iran-backed Houthis claimed a drone and missile attack that struck inside the United Arab Emirates' capital earlier in the week - a major escalation in the conflict in Yemen where the Saudi-led coalition, with the UAE as a member, has battled the rebels since 2015. \nTaha al-Motawakel, Health Minister in the Houthi government which controls northern Yemen, said 70 detainees were killed at the prison and that he expected the number to rise as many others were seriously wounded.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/57e41d7d79514a558a0256904579e73b"
