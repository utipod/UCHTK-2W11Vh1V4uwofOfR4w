description = "(4 Feb 2022) As the Winter Olympics opening ceremony began on Friday, 63-year old Liu Wenbin was just one of many excited Beijing residents watching the event on television. \nIt didn't matter if Beijing had just held the Games 14 years ago, or that the country had to artificially construct snow, or that the U.S. along with several other Western countries were staging a diplomatic boycott.\nMany Chinese were filled with pride, like Liu, who filmed the opening ceremony on his phone as he watched in his home in western Beijing. \n"As a Chinese person, I feel incomparably proud," Liu said. "Our great China really is no. 1, even when the pandemic is so severe, we're still able to hold this international event, the Winter Olympics." \nLiu, a retiree from Beijing, was unable to see the event up close this year as tickets were only available to select groups owing to pandemic prevention measures. \nIn 2008, he was too busy at work to be able to snag tickets to the Games, he said with some regret. The Chinese government, in hosting the Winter Olympics, has actively promoted winter sports, and that has successfully spread to some of its population.\nLiu, who is from Beijing, said he sometimes takes his grandson to go skiing or skating. The family even went to Zhangjiakou, where part of the competition will be held, to see the ski trails, made with artificial snow from an intricate irrigation project. \nAnd all the fervor and controversy abroad didn't bother him in the slightest. \n"I think some countries are biased, and that's very natural," he said of the diplomatic boycott. "When you are living well, of course there will be someone who's jealous."\nThe U.S., Britain and others did not send officials in protest over China’s human rights abuses and its treatment of Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/cfe08117d59e450685a108ee8be7848c"
