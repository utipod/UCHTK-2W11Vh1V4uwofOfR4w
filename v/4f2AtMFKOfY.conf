description = "(28 Jan 2022) Divers, veterinarians and the coast guard were mounting a rescue operation Friday to help a whale calf that had become trapped in shallow water in a seaside area of the Greek capital.\nThe animal was an injured young Cuvier’s beaked whale, or Ziphius cavirostris, according to Arion, a research organization that provides veterinary care for stranded cetaceans. \nThe species usually inhabits deep waters, and it was unclear how it had been injured and why it became stranded in the Alimos area of southern Athens. \nOn Thursday, the whale had been sighted in shallow water in the nearby area of Vouliagmeni, and divers had been called in to lead it out to sea. \nThe operation had initially appeared successful, but the animal returned to shallow waters Friday morning.\n“The prognosis unfortunately isn’t good,” said Environment and Energy Deputy Minister Giorgos Amyras, who was at the scene. \n“The fact that it has been in these shallow waters for so many hours doesn’t give us much hope. But we of course are doing everything possible to save the animal,” he added. \nHe said two specialized veterinarians, a specialized veterinary nurse and four aid organizations had been brought in to try to save the whale.\nA blood sample had been drawn and sent for analysis to determine what medication the animal might need, while an antibiotic had already been administered, Amyras said.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ed395412adff4c698231f4291bef289c"
