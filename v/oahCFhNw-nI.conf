description = "(28 Jan 2022) Germany expressed regret Friday that Russia has announced the suspension of mutual military inspections at a time of heightened tensions between Moscow and NATO.\nThe inspections are intended as confidence-building measures among members of the Organizations for Security and Cooperation in Europe.\nA spokesman for Germany's Foreign Ministry said Russia recently announced it would suspend the inspections until the end of February, citing the spread of the omicron variant.\n"Because of this an inspection on Russian territory in the border region of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia, which Latvia requested and Russia had previously agreed to, won't currently be possible," said the spokesman, Christofer Burger.\n"We expressly regret this step because particularly in the current situation anything which creates greater transparency would help reduce tensions," he said. "That's why we are calling on Russia to voluntarily and extensively inform OSCE member states about its activities."\nBurger said Russia had also unilaterally canceled inspections it was due to conduct in Germany.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6f34c5e2f8a74278bfb103d1a661cb72"
