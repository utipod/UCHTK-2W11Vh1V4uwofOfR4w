description = "(4 Feb 2022) Iraq's Yazidi community, from which many women and children were kidnapped and enslaved by the Islamic State group in 2014, welcomed on Friday the news of the death of the IS leader during a U.S. raid in Syria.\nDisplaced Yazidis living in Sharia Camp, in Iraq's Dohuk governorate —  many of whom are women who suffered at the hands of IS —  expressed relief about the death of Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi.\nThe IS leader blew himself up along with members of his family as American forces raided his Syria hideout Thursday, the U.S. said.\nGawri Khedhir, a Yazidi woman from Sinjar, was taken along with her family by IS militants when they took over the district in August 2014. She was taken by the militants to the nearby Tel Afar town before managing to escape in 2016. \nHer husband, son and daughter are still missing since then. \nAccording to an Associated Press report published in May 2020, al-Qurayshi was a religious judge at the time and labeled one of the architects of the militant group's enslavement of Iraq's Yazidi religious minority.\nHe rose to become deputy to IS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. \nThe operation of killing al-Qurayshi came as IS has been trying for a resurgence, with a series of attacks in the region, including an assault late last month to seize a prison in northeast Syria holding at least 3,000 IS detainees, it's boldest operation in years. \nHana Shakir, a Yazidi survivor who was in IS captivity and returned in 2018, said she still has fears that the militants might make a comeback.\n"We want to achieve our rights. I mean the elimination of those who did this to us," she said, speaking from her tent in Sharia Camp.\nIS tried to exterminate the Yazidis, a religious minority with beliefs that distinguish them from Muslim and Christian worshippers in the region.\nIS destroyed villages and religious sites, lined men up and shot them before kidnapping thousands of women and children, trading them in modern-day chattel slavery.\nThe United Nations has called the IS assault on the Yazidis' ancestral homeland in northern Iraq in 2014 a genocide, saying the Yazidis' 400,000-strong community "had all been displaced, captured or killed."\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/55f7aae8a9c3494aab1b0ea685548bea"
