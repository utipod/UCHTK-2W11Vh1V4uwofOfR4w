"My life has been filled with the Olympics."\nThough eager to be part of the Winter Games scheduled to open Friday, Zhang couldn't be a volunteer or buy a ticket for the opening ceremony, due to strict coronavirus measures.\nMeanwhile, hundreds of Beijing residents queued in front of a Beijing Olympics souvenir store for a chance to purchase memorabilia.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/82a33f8db8504cd2884a82fd7d30a814"
