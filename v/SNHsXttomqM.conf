title = "Killed officer's widow lashes out at Manhattan DA"
description = "(28 Jan 2022) Through tears, the wife, Dominique Luzuriaga, of slain police officer Jason Rivera, 22, recalled the horror of seeing cellphone alerts about two officers being shot in Harlem. \nHer worries grew as she texted and called the former elementary school classmate she married this past October. \nShe got no answer until the call that summoned her to a hospital where he was pronounced dead.\nLuzuriaga made the comments while speaking Friday morning at her husband's funeral at St. Patrick's Cathedral.\nAuthorities are still investigating what motivated the gunman, who was shot by a third officer and later died.\nLuzuriaga lashed out at new Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg, a Democrat who has instructed prosecutors not to pursue certain cases, including some allegations of resisting arrest.\n"The system continues to fail us. We are not safe anymore. Not even the members of the service," Luzuriaga said.\nBragg, who had no involvement with the officers' killer, responded in a statement that he was grieving and praying for the slain officers and will "vigorously prosecute cases of violence against police."\nRivera was barely into his second year on the force. He and Officer Wilbert Mora were fatally wounded a week ago when a gunman ambushed them in an apartment as they responded to a family dispute.\nPolice filled the pews at St. Patrick's Cathedral Friday, and a sea of blue uniforms stretched for blocks as snow drifted outside the city's iconic church.\n\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork \nTwitter: https://twitter.com/AP_Archive \nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/APArchives ​​\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/APNews/\n\n\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2c0145ddbc9145a9ba05519a7707bb0d"
